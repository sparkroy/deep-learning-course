"the casino has an old appearance , decor .",2

i liked this hotel !,2
the food and drinks were good too .,2
unfortunately my girlfriend and i made the mistake of actually getting a room here .,2
"all in all , i would not go back .",2
the chinese chicken salad is a great compliment and totally delicious .,2
the front desk lady kept trying to put me into a smaller room .,2
our server was also very friendly and did a great job .,2
the stuffed dates are excellent and the mac & cheese is heaven .,2
even if i had a free night i would not stay there again .,2
they sent me to new york new york .,2
i think i have a new favorite shoe store !,2
our server was neil and he was very informative and attentive to our needs .,2
"i love tapas , and these guys do it well .",2
i got a small beef taco and a chicken taco .,2
having a view of the fountains during dinner was an added bonus .,2
everything i 've tried here so far was really good .,2
the kitchen could n't even spare a second to check if it was done ?,2
my husband and i were asked _num_ times in one day before _num_ am .,2
very attentive and compassionate .,2
was not greeted by cashier .,2
a testament to it 's goodness !,2
why not just update all the rooms ?,2
much better filipino food elsewhere and not overpriced as this place .,2
the kids had such a good time !,2
no bacon at the buffet breakfast !,2
stay far away from this place !,2
everything we had was absolutely yummy .,2
my husband was ill and stayed behind .,2
"great atmosphere , but the food was unremarkable and overpriced .",2
the reason why i gave it another star was because of the customer service .,2
but alize should really just give up already .,2
by far one of the best experiences i have had in vegas !,2
"customer service is pretty much non existent , they 're rude and slow .",2
the bread was freaking awesome !,2
by far one of my favorite places to dine in vegas !,2
"the steak was perfect , flavorful , tender , and delicious .",2
best wig shop hands down in vegas .,2
small plates so bring other people and order a lot to share .,2
also the annoying security asking for room keys everytime by the elevators !,2
"he was prompt on delivery and pick up , and set up everything nicely .",2
this is the worst vegas experience i have ever had .,2
i will not be staying at this hotel in the future .,2
also ... the ac units are crazy loud .,2

it was so loud and lasted it for over _num_ minutes .,2
"also , the sangria is quite tasty .",2
"perhaps it really is quite good , or maybe i began with low expectations .",2
cons : front desk staff hate their job .,2
i 've stayed at many caesars properties but this one has been the worst .,2
they 're open late and the sangria is also quite delicious !,2
"so , we ordered more ... big mistake .",2
"or heck , just go for really good soup and bread !",2
thanks to the entire hugo boss staff at the forum shops location !,2
this place will make for a great night in vegas .,2
it was the highlight of our meal ( as was the creamed corn ) .,2
the food is made to order and tastes great .,2
i would recommend this place to anyone that enjoys tapas .,2
only some of the veggies were actually cooked .,2
it 's not worth it .,2

the bread is also delicious !,2
"no , i 'll never have pizza here again .",2
"the place is clean , easy to locate and staff is friendly and prompt .",2
second of all the air conditioning was way too loud .,2
my wife took my watch eight months ago to get it fixed .,2
please do n't waste your time here .,2
normally we have to wait about 15-20 minutes .,2
i just ignored them even when they are just saying good morning .,2
it was very blah .,2
so there is no `` sure fire '' time to get valet .,2
it has so many stops to the strip .,2
i loved the tomato soup and grilled brie sandwich .,2
"this store is beautiful , the staff was very polite and helpful .",2
the place is kind of outdated and needs new clean carpet !,2
i do n't even know where to start this place is soo horrible .,2
pretty much an overpriced .,2
you got the wrong one !,2
it 's still a winner .,2
"when i checked into my room , the bathtub had a clogged drain .",2
i doubt i will get food from here again .,2
the wait staff is professional and courteous .,2
", things got annoying upon our arrival at the harrah 's .",2
"now , again , i understand this , as frustrating as it was .",2

"sensational food , great service and fun people watching .",2

gorgeous flowers for our wedding .,2
fantastic service and amazing tech guys .,2
portion sizes were great & the atmosphere was amazing .,2
but the pool was nice and buffet is reasonable .,2
"well worth the money , it was truly an experience of a lifetime !",2
we will definitely be back for more .,2

the ginger was perfect and the oysters tasted fresh like the sea .,2
bar staff was great .,2
went there super hung over from an epic night and the food is perfect .,2

"a classic in las vegas , has been here for years .",2

( not sure if it 's per night ) .,2

both events are ideal fun for the whole family .,2
motel six without the amenities .,2
"unorganized and messy , it 's almost impossible to find anything purchase here .",2
his pastas have incredible texture and the flavors are simply amazing .,2
i would argue this is hardly a resort .,2

we did n't stay for very long .,2
the food is fresh and authentic .,2
service was also great .,2
uni was brown and it tasted nasty .,2

the service was great and so were the drinks .,2
the atmosphere is chaotic with lots of loud screaming children .,2
"tapas is my absolute favorite , and this place is heavenly .",2
the tapas are delectable .,2
a helpful lift up and down the strip .,2
perfect for a large gathering or romantic dinner date in a comfy corner booth .,2
our room _num_ reeked of mildew !,2
"i feel bad giving two stars to the excalibur , but it deserves it .",2
the casino feels old and stinky .,2
they 're also very inexpensive !,2
very friendly and has the best customer service ever .,2
thanks for having a nice facility for us to shoot in !,2
good location just a few blocks from the strip .,2
there was no wifi which was thoroughly disappointing .,2
old world charm and delicious food .,2
"no explanation , just `` you ca n't '' .",2
so i guess it was ok ... but check this out .,2
large rooms at a good price .,2
it 's by far the best place ever .,2
the room was dirty and several things were broken or in need of maintenance .,2
"if you have kids , you got ta stay here !",2
i barely would even consider there food edible if starving to death .,2
great place for tapas .,2
i guess that 's why excalibur is so cheap .,2
how many `` bars '' can have that honor ?,2
found this place while wandering inside the venetian .,2
we then waited an additional _num_ minutes past the original appointment time .,2
tv was a bonus for the kids too !,2
"after the shrimp disaster , we asked again about our first order .",2
overall she was very pleasant .,2

this was worse than the first time .,2
they are aggressive and very rude .,2
they are very rude .,2
the prices are extremely reasonable and the tapas are really good .,2
fun and vibrant place that fills up .,2
the took over _num_ minutes to find me package on back storage .,2
the sauce was so good !,2
"just expect hard beds , outdated decor and slim options for dining .",2
their food really went downhill .,2
they actually laugh at you when you lose money .,2
a half yard with strawberry margarita or pina colada with an extra shot please .,2
"wonderful job , keep up the good work !",2
salsa had an amazing flavor and a kick to it .,2
the food is awesome .,2
"nobody cares about you , they just see you as `` tip money '' .",2
im not sure which was worse the food or the horrid service .,2
"actually , the rooms at motel _num_ probably would have been nicer .",2
super convenient and well priced compared to another competitors around the strip !,2
management or house keeping or security never once checked up on us .,2
our instructor bob was not only informative but made the experience fun and entertaining .,2
"again , the location is n't that bad .",2
full cost for resort fees though .,2
"a restaurant changes , they change the sign .",2
even the bread and butter is good here .,2

the pool and spa closes at 6pm .,2

the only thing that was pretty good was their egg rolls .,2

get a pitcher of sangria or mojito to really make things fun .,2
it hit the spot .,2
and the one on the strip next to harrah 's is pretty decent .,2
the buffet at the excalibur was very cheap _num_ for _num_ ( _num_ ) .,2
thank you i highly recommend maurice and diamond events !,2
this is our vegas fuel !,2
great food and drink .,2
the food is always great .,2
not nearly enough napkins were provided for the amount of people that were dining .,2
it 's my favorite drink !,2
most of all very rude .,2
`` she can pay with a check why would you tell her that ? '',2
it 's a tapas restaurant so order a variety from the menu and share .,2
i loved the suite .,2
she then proceeded to put the menu into the stand without cleaning it .,2
"oh god , i pity him now .",2
the sheets had holes and stains and the furniture was older than i am .,2
we definitely will be back .,2
all come with their house salad and potatoes & vegetables .,2
i can honestly say that these shoes are the most comfortable shoes ever !,2
the side dishes arrived at the table for my guests and myself cold .,2
wo n't be going back .,2
_num_ ) do they not clean their shot glasses ?,2
you will love going here esp .,2

everyone in our group of _num_ or so seemed to have a good time !,2
the rolls were just ok - there are better places out there .,2
definitely going back when i get back to vegas .,2
i could 've easily stolen anything .,2
"stayed here once , for the price i was n't expecting much .",2

"overall , i 've had much better .",2

everything is super delish !,2
i like this place and it seems very popular .,2
what a lovely little gem .,2
i love the strawberry margarita !,2

i would not recommend using this place .,2
we had a very solid experience at spago .,2
the worst ross i have ever been to .,2
had a good time tho great people and tall size drinks .,2
that 's how horrible it is .,2
i would call this `` the worse denny 's ever '' .,2
the green tea ice cream tasted artificial .,2
i love the variety of island dishes .,2
worst experience in vegas by far !,2
they were both perfect as well .,2
great place with good ambience .,2
"good value , and delicious .",2
i did n't have high expectations coming here anyways .,2
the room however did n't smell like the rest of the place .,2
both times my group left happy and satisfied .,2
i liked this hotel mainly because of the swimming pool for the guests .,2
probably understaffed for the night .,2
firefly makes a great pitcher or three .,2
"nicely done , very moist pan seared .",2
"all in all , they nailed it !",2
the food is good here .,2
"while the sushi was decent , the service was absolutely horrible .",2
it was possibly the best prepared duck breast i 've ever had anywhere .,2
god knows i was craving since lunchtime .,2
the maid went into my jewelry box and stole my earrings .,2
small little bar with fresh oysters .,2
service very good and timely .,2
"ultimately , i feel they lied online to get customers in through the doors .",2
i called housekeeping and they came and cleaned the room fairly quickly .,2
had a wonderful experience for my first time in a mac store !,2

so have booked a room for my son and i for golden nugget instead .,2
"we are going back this april , with our _num_ boys .",2
you have got to eat this food !,2
the workers are great and helpful .,2
this is the best of the best .,2
called them to get a hardly worn pair of shoes fixed .,2
"the best bread , and free range chicken ever !",2
i 've never dealt with such rude employees .,2
some are quite annoying but they never stop !,2
we came here for dinner during restaurant week and had a great experience .,2
oh and the chips and salsa was great too !,2
this is a common food for americans .,2
"update : again , just heard more stuff have been stolen from rooms .",2
always nostalgic about ny when i grab breakfast here .,2
not worth an extra star though .,2
i immediately went to the front desk and demanded a new room .,2
ive been here three times and it gets worse every time .,2
the drinks were very good as well .,2
great little bagel shop with a diner feel .,2
"guess what , they were out of range .",2
fat tuesdays is a great drinking chain .,2
i want the old grill master back .,2
i had the worst experience ever !,2
guess they did n't learn much from that experience .,2
_num_ tickets for a mini bottle of bubbles ?,2
"okay , it 's vegas , i can handle that .",2
must ... go ... back !,2
my friend and i both got a pasta dish and they were great !,2
agree with most of the negative reviews i have seen .,2
_num_ of us each got one of these .,2
"we waited about half an hour to get seated , which was fine .",2
this restaurant is fantastic .,2
cheese board spread was tasty as well .,2
good place for a date day or night .,2
the layout was very neat and there was a lot of variety .,2
"let me just say , take someone with you if you try it on .",2
"sucks , but it is what is .",2
"if you 're renting a car though , stay away !",2
to add on the service was not that great either .,2
bread came out burnt and the sirloin was rare .,2
well worth the trip and $ !,2
"as for the rest of the store , it 's only ok .",2
no wifi ( wtf ! ),2
"food , service , and prices were perfect !",2
"for a convention center , i 've had better , much better .",2
very sparse on any room amenities however the bed was good .,2
the favors were perhaps too bold for me that i could only eat one .,2
waited _num_ minutes for a burrito and _num_ tacos in the drive thru .,2
this store has an excellent selection .,2
the staff is super friendly too .,2
my tummy might hurt a little bit but it 's worth it .,2
i 've stayed at the excalibur twice and the level of service is atrocious .,2
we wo n't be back .,2
thank you for a very pleasant experience .,2
we will not stay here ever again .,2
the food was very filling but the service was not the best .,2
but our room had roaches !,2
my sister had to help me get out of the stupid thing !,2
"by far , the worst , most disgusting hotel i have ever stayed in .",2
good drinks that are strong and priced right for vegas .,2
excellent sangria - get a pitcher !,2
we have stayed at harrahs las vegas a half dozen times .,2
my room was average with two queen beds .,2
krispy kreme upstairs makes it less painful .,2
everything is super yummy !,2
"when i asked for more , they all of a sudden ran out .",2
it was great that they offered free half an hour circus shows .,2
well the fat older lady just completely lost it .,2
everything was full of amazing flavor !,2
the steak was cooked perfect ( medium rare ) and the service was great .,2
such a waste of insurance money .,2
which is nice to see your friends jump with you .,2
our sever jesus greeted us right away and made some fantastic recommendations .,2
do not go to this show even if you have a free ticket .,2
"the food is always good , inexpensive and easy to get to .",2
the monorail was clean and easily got us to our destinations .,2
i love walking around the shops .,2
definitely better than the other rooms we had paid the same price for previously .,2
every thing we ate was cold in the middle .,2
"the sauce was ok , and the ingredients were flat .",2
got a full bikini wax for the first time .,2
"excellent , friendly service !",2
i wish i could give this _num_ stars for that alone .,2
"besides the tiny margarita we got , everything else was great !",2
my horror story does n't end with this .,2
the sales associates were very helpful .,2
"you have to like sweet coffee , but it was soooooo good !",2
a nice flight of tequila to start things off .,2
not normally a tapas person but i was very pleasantly surprised by it .,2
our table was not clean .,2

my boys had so much fun .,2
also no fridge or microwave .,2
cold food after a long wait .,2
they were so lovely and patient !,2
we have been loyal to harrah for over _num_ years .,2
the staff is rude and very lazy .,2
these guys were super !,2
he did n't try to accommodate and was n't polite about it at all .,2
the staff did n't know my insurance after being there three times .,2
it 's an outlet .,2
mediocre at the best .,2
this is a good place .,2
"next time , i 'd probably splurge a little more on a nicer hotel .",2
still great breakfast and good value in a sketchy shopping strip .,2
great food and very flavorful !,2
my group decided on harrah 's for its location and relatively low room rates .,2
this was an amazing restaurant .,2
i love that about my doctor .,2
"unfortunately , all good things apparently must come to an end .",2
check out the one also in the mgm .,2

the food and customer service was beyond top notch .,2
"_num_ for room service , the food was actually awesome .",2

assuming water was added because it was not that hot .,2
they were sick for three days with it .,2
the staff were nice so okay we gave it a shot .,2
our room was robbed some time after 5pm yesterday .,2
"so another friend ordered a side of fruit , which we never got .",2
she is warm and have an amazing eye for beauty .,2
the security is inept .,2
mojitos are very good .,2
i went back to the decatur store on may _num_ .,2

i will be back for years to come !,2
they stated they put a bag over it and ran it through the carwash .,2
"he is kind , very straight forward and to the point .",2
"as someone from the philly area , driving by had me pretty excited .",2
"not many people actually shop here , but just walking through is exciting .",2
the tub was very cozy !,2
will definitely be back to try some of their drinks .,2
this location has been nothing but a huge hassle .,2
i would not suggest staying here if you can afford better .,2
the variety was a nice touch .,2
the food is pretty tasty .,2
great seats outside the forum .,2
are n't they making enough money off the casino ?,2

extremely rude staff member .,2
"good price , room was actually nicer than i had expected .",2
store manager made my bad experience a worst one for sure .,2
"it has the best vibe , best service and best food .",2
this was definitely our favorite thing we did !,2
had a great little dinner here with friends .,2
the low ceiling and poor lighting are kind of depressing .,2
i should n't even give this place a star !,2
pricier dishes but definitely worth it in my opinion .,2
the starbucks in harrahs does not .,2
i would like to give them _num_ .,2
"all cars come with a two month , _num_ mile power train warranty .",2
the service is great and not pushy at all .,2
when we are in vegas with the family this is my go to spot .,2
good for kids with pool and bath tubs .,2
( my mother-in-law said the flowers were beautiful . ),2
the staff is incredibly friendly too .,2
"gold star for brandon , our server , thank you !",2
the fish here was not fresh !,2
you just wo n't feel welcome at all for being there .,2
"light , delicious , and right outside the casino .",2
8th floor and room _num_ . '',2
that was my fault but i hate to break the flow of a meal .,2
i ended ordering a couple of things for friends at work .,2
there are not enough waitresses .,2
fat tuesday seemed like the best place to go !,2
we walk in and they take _num_ minutes for a server to show up .,2
"first trip and first yelp , but highly impressed .",2
"the buffet was awful , with price outrageous .",2
come here and take a refreshing break from the strip .,2
loved the monorail and had no problems with tickets or anything .,2
our service was top grade .,2
not going there again .,2
"fourth , everything tasted warm but on the cold side .",2
whats the point if you cant use it anywhere in the casino .,2
leave a bit of room for dessert as the pastry chef is amazing !,2
"resort fees were indeed included , as well as upgrade fees .",2
"but _num_ minutes later , we get the tomato juice ?",2
i came here for lunch with my girlfriends .,2
each course 's wine pairing felt like a natural compliment .,2
won $ _num_ bucks and ran to the buffet .,2
i thought it was overpriced and a waste of time .,2
"yummy big drinks , this place is great !",2
"there was no refrigerator , microwave , or coffee maker .",2
( i certainly wish i did ! ),2
my experience at excalibur was average at best .,2
i liked that they have a lot of nickel machines to play slots .,2
all the sangria 's are good and they will give you a good buzz .,2
this place if awful .,2
excalibur has a pretty confusing layout actually despite seemingly being a square .,2
drinks are expensive like every where else in vegas .,2
definitely nice for people watching .,2
a great light dessert before dancing the night away in vegas .,2
the extra shot is just $ _num_ and definitely worth it .,2
the heat you will not use alot cause its hardly freezing outside !,2
the atmosphere was great and the service was excellent .,2
the selection of stores here is only average .,2
the excalibur certainly was not that place .,2
"try the steak and mushroom skewers , amazing !",2
she said that was not her job .,2
super fast free wifi .,2
we had an excellent stay at the circus circus .,2
no lie i waited _num_ .,2
the good part is it does n't have an casino full with cigarette smoke .,2
_num_ minutes later she came to ask another question .,2
"resort fee is ridiculous ( $ _num_ ) , you get nothing for it .",2
the cuban sandwiches are amazing .,2
i definitely will come back with my friends when i 'm in town .,2
"was in two different rooms , neither had internet available .",2
great ratio of seafood and veggies .,2
if it was n't for the free offers i would n't stay here !,2
"what a great night out , we will be back !",2
"if you 're getting free room offers , this is an okay hotel .",2
this hotel does n't offer anything for a business traveler ... go elsewhere !,2
i love seating in the upstairs bar .,2
the other person 's luggage was in the hallway too ... .,2
just about everything here is understaffed .,2
"at this point , i was at my limit .",2
nothing special for $ _num_ .,2
it did open up nicely and improved as the meal went on .,2
a caesar salad $ _num_ for a sit down breakfast $ _num_ .,2
"i was promised biscuits each time the server came , but alas !",2
both locations are amazing !,2
it feels like you went back to the 70s .,2
well im learning the hard way how bad it is .,2
i spent so much money to play in this casino .,2
they want _num_ minutes of your time and $ _num_ deposit .,2
the sliders were good as well as the calamari and sashimi .,2
"not to mention , it tasted more like crab meat than it did scallops .",2
they are very strict & safe about visitors .,2
there is something for everyone here .,2
lovely location on the canal .,2
and it was really really slimy inside .,2
the tapas are creative and delicious !,2
the monorail is very convenient especially during the hot summer months .,2
"in regards to the piano bar , it is always fun .",2
this was the biggest waste of money ever !,2
that even included drinking water .,2

unbelievable that the offered us two different table across the room from each other !,2

wow this place is soooo fun !,2
took my daughter down to the arcade .,2
"however , i apparently waited to long .",2
it is dirty and the clientele leaves a lot to be desired .,2
worth making the trip off the strip for !,2

it was creamy and perfectly cooked .,2
very soothing colors and cloth napkins for your hands !,2

i did not like this hotel at all .,2
lie to us and then stick us in a gross room .,2

when you come in smells like some one die in it !,2
"the manager was a tall man , bald and was not sympathetic at all .",2
would n't stay here again .,2
"oh , and all towels smelled of mildew .",2
well worth the investment !,2
the thermostat did n't work .,2
great selection of tapas and awesome sparkling sangria !,2
the food was so good that i decided to start writing reviews on yelp .,2
the service was great although the place was packed !,2
i had mixed feelings about the other features of the hotel .,2

decided to stop here for some late night eats after a night spent downtown .,2
they were amazingly good .,2
this is the worst denny 's i 've ever been to .,2
i 'd recommend it .,2
something as simple as the parmesan fries with aioli are amazing .,2
pool : what a dump !,2
i guess it 's ok if you do n't mind the old vibe .,2
the slots did n't pay out for us at all .,2
but that has already been said .,2
harrahs scores high from me .,2
"great food , wonderful staff and fun atmosphere .",2
i was very dissatisfied with the room .,2
"stood in tower _num_ , needs to updated badly .",2
you are right smack in the middle of the vegas strip .,2
needless to say we wo n't recommend or every stay at the excalibur again .,2
sadly excalibur is no exception .,2
the sangria is by far the best in town .,2
this is a great find for both locals and visitors .,2
our room was located in the 25th floor in tower _num_ .,2
server was alright not that she was great but she was n't bad .,2
def try breakfast here and the bagels are the best in town !,2

no one ever asked though .,2
they have the best sangria hands down .,2
"but sadly , i will not stay in the hotel here again .",2
the food and menu looks like it has n't changed in _num_ years .,2
bagels was n't the best i 've had .,2
they were not busy at all still took so long to get me started .,2
"seriously , get rid of these clowns !",2
"worse still , harrah 's seems to be the only one .",2
the mac and cheese was also delicious .,2
"really , the most thorough museum tour i 've ever done .",2
this lack of competition also makes them not care about marketing .,2
housekeeping is so loud .,2
it would have been a better experience to do it myself at home .,2
if i could give this dump a zero i would !,2
"i must say , i am glad we only ordered _num_ plates .",2
the pasta option i ordered for dinner was well done and damn tasty .,2
the beers were pretty yucky anyway so i did n't care .,2
the casino staff is more helpful than the hotel staff .,2
"the bartender , aaron , is awesome !",2
"the guy working , cesar , was so unbelievably rude .",2
they made the situation like it was our fault .,2
they made the situation like it was our fault .,2
well worth the price !,2
there is no actual street access .,2
not necessarily flavorful - but humongous .,2
the clientele in the casino were very creepy .,2
i wish it was possible to give `` _num_ '' stars .,2
"they said they could accommodate us , no problem .",2
i am very disappointed .,2
i am very disappointed .,2
my meal at firefly was the best in vegas by far .,2
it smelled like old motel .,2
point is do not waste time on this place !,2
the bartenders are really nice and quick .,2
"i however , mind and will not be staying here ever again .",2
one of my favorite restaurants in vegas for sure !,2
the food is okay but expensive for vegas .,2
"excellent service , nice atmosphere , good food , and great drinks .",2

and the service is always top notch .,2
"without even asking , they brought me edamame and miso soup .",2
and it 's fun .,2

i do not recommend nor will i ever use them in the future .,2
an enormous place that has everything you could possibly want .,2
the guy was really nice .,2
im not sure i would have finished my orders .,2
but i had the worse experience ever .,2
great menu and great atmosphere .,2
i do n't know how the workers can work here .,2
the bagel was good .,2
located inside ph miracle mile and a quick and affordable stop for a treat .,2
which makes sense of all the trash !,2
we had to do that ourselves and had a great time .,2
this was a mistake .,2
nice gesture but this is not a welcome pack .,2
our tower _num_ room had a view of the monorail .,2
i walked in here twice .,2
the wait is almost always a minimum of _num_ hours .,2
i have a sleep numbers bed .,2
just a blanket with two sheets around it .,2
we sat at the bar with an extraordinary bartender named emily .,2
the veal shank ( osso bucco ) was fork tender but bland .,2
she does n't typically like cheese steak sandwiches .,2
orange juice is fresh squeezed and coffee is good .,2
i took my gf here and it was good dining experience .,2
but the food was also really good !,2
it 's not even worthy of a star .,2
yummy food and tasty sangria !,2
reminds me of islands back home .,2
just the worst ever .,2
i highly recommend this store and their outstanding staff .,2
"excalibur hotel is a giant , cheap motel .",2
service was good enough .,2
turkey club sandwich rates a very good !,2
this was on december 8th _num_ .,2
we sat in the bar and we had a piss poor server .,2
"besides the low price , there 's nothing really special about the hotel .",2
she was just absolutely terrible .,2
"so yes , you could very easily get your entre $ _num_ cheaper .",2
do n't gamble on your place to stay .,2
i should have talked to a manager .,2
"and plus , it 's just bad for business .",2
the happy hour is absolutely fabulous .,2
i had a marvelous dining experience here !,2
"will i go back , maybe if someone else buys .",2
a fairly miserable night for $ _num_ more than the original price .,2
i 'll pay top dollar for food- if it 's worth it .,2
i would be very very careful about going back there .,2
overall good experience and would recommend .,2
i love it here !,2
needed a cool refreshing snack after doing a small hike .,2
happy hour is from 4-6 pm monday - friday .,2
it was worth it .,2
but it is all really good and a great neighborhood breakfast and lunch joint .,2
ambiance - positive two stars,2
i mixed the margarita and mango and that was good .,2
"it 's not authentic , and it does not have a great menu offering .",2
i guess i was wrong .,2
"i had the shrimp , avocado and crab tower and it was delicious !",2
every thing else sucks .,2
great view of the fountains .,2
the casino is nothing special .,2
the service is always attentive .,2
we had an awesome time !,2
all the food was tasty and fresh .,2
the sangria is good but i prefer the mojito better .,2
but it was a cool experience .,2
but they could n't with harrah 's terrible wifi .,2
the best tapas restaurant i have ever been to .,2
"excalibur , not a fan .",2
leave me alone . ',2
the food is crap at best and inconsistent all the time .,2
words can not describe the disappointment i feel .,2
in reading other reviews it seems that this is not out of the ordinary .,2
my hubby and i really really like this place .,2
it was the perfect choice .,2
"firecracker shrimps , spinach dip , sesame crusted ahi ... soooo delicious !",2
"i put the sun chips back , the female employee was right there .",2
do not do business with these people .,2
my wife and i had been here years before and enjoyed it .,2
hoping for another customer service representative ( nope ! ),2
so i booked this hotel for the same reason that most do .,2
"i 'd take the kids back for sure , it was a cool experience .",2
they said they could not find me and ran it through the car wash .,2
room smelled like pissed & the sheets were dirty .,2
i ate the most amazing set of crab claws from florida .,2
it was not the worst but there is far better .,2
red sangria is very nice with lots of apple in it .,2
this place was really good .,2
the rooms are all old but for the price i guess you cant complain .,2
i went to lunch with some coworkers .,2
this was some of the best food and service we 've ever received .,2
firefly fries were pretty delicious too .,2
the site to store has certainly been a hit and miss .,2
i loved this place .,2
i loved this place .,2
avoid that tower at all cost !,2
the cheap prices are not worth it .,2
oh ... there they are ... sitting in the window .,2
we won a lot of stuffed animals and it was fun .,2
needless to say my meal is always more enjoyable when this is the case .,2
their service was very quick and friendly .,2
save the best for last .,2
why make an appointment if you do n't honor them ?,2
i am going to try to never have to stay here again.,2
could n't seem to ever get valet to park the darn car .,2
it 's like a fine wine .,2
me and my fiance stayed here while we were wedding venue hunting .,2
service had been great for the times we went .,2
would n't come here if you paid me .,2
the rooms were outdated and kind of smelled .,2
clearly vegas is trying to shake their `` family friendly '' image .,2
"every time , the fish is cooked perfectly and the service impeccable .",2
overall everything was good .,2
"great store with great employees , and the prices are good too !",2
this is no big deal .,2
went late and had park in back and hope i did n't get towed .,2
wow what a way to celebrate in vegas .,2
i also tried what my friends had ordered and everything was tasty !,2
- mediocre sushi at best .,2
"i know granted i was wearing casual clothing , but i do not steal .",2
he was n't pleasant & barely even spoke .,2
it was to hot in there i could n't sleep .,2
manager was rude as well .,2
but the club is clean and well equipped .,2
great food and great service .,2
change it & you might just drive better business .,2
what a waste of time .,2
i honestly did not know you could mess up scallops .,2
i then realized the penny was the fix !,2
this really is a great shop .,2
no room service after _num_ pm .,2
love it for the chicken entree and pizza !,2
thanks for the shitty sake !,2
"clean store , solid customer service .",2
its $ _num_ per night !,2
now this is what we crave everyday !,2
considering the prices i would never return to this establishment for any reason .,2
this stay proved that to be the case in the hotel areas as well .,2
the bartender just placed _num_ different open bottles on the bar to look at .,2
this place is fantastic !,2
now for the biggest problem of all .,2
i always order when i visit !,2
great food and service from frank .,2
"that cost $ _num_ extra , each plate .",2
check in was bad .,2
nothing in room a stained old chair desk beds and tv .,2
every employee that we ran into was nice !,2
"the piano players were fun , and they knew ever song that was requested .",2
i really enjoyed the ceviche .,2
while the server was nice and polite the food was horrible .,2
circus circus seems cleaner .,2
i did n't sleep the whole time i was there .,2
"for that type of service , the food was overpriced .",2
"i 'll be going back again , and again .",2
i wo n't stay there again .,2
i wo n't stay there again .,2
we went as a group of five and loved the atmosphere .,2
to hell with this place .,2
the concierge desk was the only highlight to this trip .,2
"the food was excellent , across the board .",2
most bullshit business ever !,2
nice ( but pricey ) shops .,2
i have stayed in a much better motel _num_ .,2
"by the way , the butt stayed there for _num_ days .",2
overall our stay sucked !,2
a little out dated and the air quality is n't the best .,2
refilled out drinks consistently ... .,2
"no wifi , but i absolutely do not care .",2
so i went without water in the desert .,2
all very good : ) i will be back .,2
we should 've ordered another one because we loved all the little desserts .,2
this meant sending the food back and waiting for it to be cooked again .,2

this place does n't care about you at all .,2
stay away from entree because the tapas are usually delicious .,2
this is the best hospital to have baby .,2

"they are slow , rude and overpriced .",2
you should make a visit when you 're in vegas !,2
", so the excalibur fit the bill .",2
but i 've been in worse hotels .,2
an upbeat group of folks .,2
"for desert we tried the flan , which was unique and super tasty .",2
the worst hotel i 've ever stayed !,2
a great place to browse if you have more time than money .,2
what a great experience .,2
the lobster bisque did not have a strong enough lobster flavour .,2
i do n't leave trash on the inside and take good care of it .,2
they accommodated us last minute for a party of fifteen so that was nice .,2
not even an offer of a phone book or anything .,2
i would not refer anyone to this car lot .,2
our stay at harrah 's was a big disappointment .,2
i think their ny strip is the finest in las vegas .,2
everyone was great and helpful !,2
very well chosen colors and pieces .,2
"absolutely would stay here again , one of the best deals on the strip !",2
the buffet was terrible as well .,2
the big problem is actually eating there .,2
so i came with them this time .,2
excellent food ... everything in the menu is great .,2
i do n't recommend & wo n't be back !,2
it made chuck e cheese look like a luxurious spa destination .,2
it was very good !,2
this is ridiculous and very wrong .,2

the food in the cafeteria is pretty tasty for being a hospital cafeteria .,2

my fianc and i decided to check out bags and just walk around .,2
came here for lunch and enjoyed how fresh the food was .,2
always great food when i 'm in vegas .,2
the restaurant was n't very crowded at all for a friday evening at 7pm .,2
great entertainment at the bar on friday and saturday nights .,2
the hotel itself was n't even worth it .,2
calls does n't take several days to pull .,2
worst car dealership ever .,2
staff provides great customer service .,2

it was pretty empty when we came .,2
i loved the food and drinks .,2
excellent place to kill time !,2
"btw , do n't get in the water !",2
i emailed them about my horrible experience and no one replied .,2
great deal would stay here again .,2
"so we requested more and when it came , it smelt like smoke .",2
the lunch special for $ _num_ was worth it .,2
the stuffed dates are delicious .,2
ate here two nights in a row .,2
it was so dry and flavorless .,2
the room and furniture were old and low quality amenities in the rooms .,2
we left the excalibur feeling rather sad .,2
amazing staff thank you again for all your care !,2
so i lucked out and got an artist all to myself !,2
great food and also nice inside .,2
it is just not worth it .,2
just save yourself the headache and go to the walgreens across the street .,2
there was a tv in the bathroom but there was no remote to it .,2
i went in at _num_ am on a thursday .,2
"beds were comfy , but no coffee pot in room .",2
definitely check it out whenever you see one .,2
we wo n't be staying there again .,2
the garlic fries were to die for !,2
being ugly in decor is one thing .,2
could n't wait to get back to my hotel after this !,2
"overall , a good choice for a less spendy meal in vegas .",2
stayed here during a meeting i had for work .,2
"_num_ small pieces of fish wrapped around stuffing , _num_ pieces of lobster !",2
it was piss poor .,2
is was very disappointing .,2
my boyfriend and i both asked it in complete horror .,2
it 's very tropical and relaxing .,2
very disappointed this time .,2
even my kids refused to have their burgers !,2
even checking out is not accommodating .,2
"lovely atmosphere in here , fun shopping .",2
so the rating can be explained either way .,2
worst of the worst in customer satisfaction .,2
no coffee maker either .,2
it 's pricey but worth every penny .,2
will definitely eat here again the next time i am in las vegas !,2
"until then , i would not stay here again .",2
everyone had the best attitude and courtesy i have experienced from a casino .,2
not for fee and not for free .,2
the casino is large though .,2
perfect spot in the forum shops .,2
contemporary means updated ( does n't it ? ),2
"so ladies , just leave the heels at home .",2
"it is not really cheap , but , they make it look that way .",2
thanks but no thanks .,2
"i found pills under my bed , there was soap stuck in the shower .",2
_num_ min to check in .,2
really amazing food ... .,2
thanks to circo for a delicious high-end vegas dinner !,2
definitely coming back to get another one next time !,2
the doors do not close all the way unless pushed or pulled .,2
the extra shot will do you some good .,2

the empanadas were delicious as well .,2
but have enjoyed everything else .,2

delicious salmon and shrimp quesadilla .,2
your clothes smell like it after _num_ mins in the hotel .,2
"ok , no big deal , just exchange it .",2
"great atmosphere , food , and drinks -- the sangria is awesome .",2
octane is their most popular drink and for good reason : it 's strong .,2
"i know some people relish it , i do n't .",2
the best meal and service in a long time .,2
avoid at all costs no matter the price .,2
the food makes it really cool .,2
all three items were outstanding !,2
she said she would have a manager call me .,2
we stayed for _num_ days .,2
our room in the mardi gras tower was sub par at best .,2
one of the best tapas restaurants i 've ever been to .,2
hit up firefly is you want something different that wont cost you mega bucks .,2
it is extremely outdated .,2
it was very bland and lacked flavor .,2
maybe old but fun for the kids .,2
firefly is the most authentic i have had in the states !,2
best value in vegas .,2
the one that hands you the food has an attitude problem .,2
it was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of fresh mozzarella cheese .,2
i think the owners are going for quantity not quality .,2
little clever plays on the traditional to make something unique .,2
"after today , i 'll never go here again .",2
the pool closed at _num_ pm ( the water slide at 6pm ) .,2
the ribs was extremely dry .,2

it was n't worth it !,2
i did find some batteries here as my camera ran out of power .,2
"but thankfully , the meatloaf was delicious , my pizza was great .",2
she also can does an excellent job waxing my eye browns .,2
not a pleasant way to shop at victoria 's secret .,2
it 's a good place to stay in vegas if you have kids .,2
you will waste your money and come out sick or hungry or both .,2
"all in all , one of the reasons i stopped going to subway .",2
spago is a great place with good menu items .,2
they were trying to charge me for the dinner price !,2
"good price and customers service , i love this place !",2
the hotel itself is like a maze which i did n't enjoy .,2
secondly this place sucks .,2
there was hardly any walking space between and around the _num_ queen beds .,2
why do they have to charge an arm and a leg for clothes ?,2
the three associates were all standing by the cash register .,2
quite an array of choices i might add .,2
"infused water available at _num_ different locations , comfy towels .",2
the valet sucked and was full every night we were there .,2
this place is the worst hotel in vegas .,2
they were delicious too .,2
airport shuttle is $ _num_ per person - cash only .,2
in case i did n't say it .,2
the entire menu is outstanding and very affordable .,2
all of my friends and i really enjoyed ourselves .,2
i 've been several times and keep forgetting to give them a write up !,2
there are a couple decent places to drink and eat in here as well .,2
dana was our server and she was just terrible !,2
i 'd be more understanding if the place was busy but it was not .,2
wo n't ever be spending another penny inside this place again .,2
i really enjoyed going to fat tuesday .,2
"yuck , after my first experience here i will never come back .",2
receiving our soup within _num_ minutes and then our main course in _num_ hour !,2
"after dining there , i can see why .",2
very delicious and conveniently located close to shops and casino floor .,2
i recommend you do this while in vegas !,2
great wine selection also .,2
having to go down to get the other ... kind of annoying .,2
definitely a great place to bring friends when they come into town .,2
we chose the excalibur because it was cheap .,2
great food and excellent service !,2
only reason to stay here is for a cheap night along the strip .,2
the store is disorganized and nothing makes sense .,2
"last time i ate here , i saw roaches running around .",2
my burger was ordered medium and came out well done and not hot .,2
i cant wait to come back here again !,2
jumping up and down .,2
"great food , excellent prices and a happening ambiance .",2
ca n't say enough good about firefly - i was very impressed .,2
the room was $ _num_ and right on the strip .,2
one of the best experiences in las vegas that ive been to .,2
everyone in our party raved about the authenticity of their meal .,2
it took them _num_ minutes of research to get nothing .,2
the rooms are very outdated early _num_ 's maybe ?,2
day two was great .,2
"however , the furnishings are tired and worn .",2
"fun , easy , and great for everyone !",2
let 's be honest ... no one was expecting _num_ stars here .,2
we also had a the dessert sampler and everything on it was great .,2
now i totally understand the ash tray smell in vegas .,2
the first room we had was horrible .,2
"it comes hand made , fresh and delicious !",2
worst setup i 've seen in a hotel room .,2
i will definitely be coming back .,2
lunch is amazing and dinner is really good as well .,2
super friendly and well educated .,2
we enjoyed a caesar salad and the sausage and red pepper pizza .,2
spend your dollars elsewhere .,2
the pork barbacoa is incredible .,2
we got prosciutto and arugula - super good .,2
my husband and i stayed here over the forth of july weekend .,2
our waitress was super nice and we loved having a seat by the canal .,2
it was a disaster from the beginning .,2
the atmosphere was fantastic .,2
stuck in time perfectly .,2
so i have a new favorite !,2
"it 's not the employees fault though , they are all pretty decent .",2
cons : price for dishes are a little on the high side .,2
my soup was good however umm there was no lobster in it .,2
i do n't like being forced to pay for things i will not use .,2
happy hour would be good here .,2
"the flan was so good , we ordered another .",2
they actually have a toy store !,2
"the pool area was just concrete & water , not much fun .",2
"some staff members were friendly , others not so much .",2
key tip is book the west tower .,2
this mall leaves a lot to be desired .,2
it has such great breakfast the bagels seem homemade and everything was incredible .,2
"the ride itself on the help was over one hour , which was amazing .",2
i 'm so pleased with them and i ca n't wait to go back .,2
but it 's not .,2
so if you 've had enough to drink you probably wo n't mind it .,2
great staff very fun experience .,2
i 'm so sad she 's not here . '',2
the hotel is old and stinks .,2
"service was slow , do n't go there if you 're on lunch break .",2
"wow , super good !",2
the meat was dry .,2
"food , bar , service and experience were all outstanding .",2
"food , bar , service and experience were all outstanding .",2
sad how this hotel is going downhill fast .,2
a one of a kind experience for my wife and i .,2
had lunch here with family and had a great time .,2
this hotel gave me the most frustrating experience i 've ever had in vegas .,2
great new york style bagels lox and all the trimmings .,2
i regret opening store credit here .,2
( it is n't their place to move my seat setting . ),2
( it is n't their place to move my seat setting . ),2
the only reason why i went here was someone else was paying for it .,2
this was the worst casino we visited while in vegas .,2
the staff also said happy birthday .,2
the room was clean but had the smell of a motel .,2
the house chopped salad with quinoa is so freshly made with garden fresh veggies .,2
let me tell you `` just rip-off '' .,2
as well has terrible customer service .,2
incredibly soft and fit great .,2
"tram to and from excalibur , luxor , and mandalay bay .",2
prices are great too .,2
"oh my goodness , do i ever love this place .",2
great atmosphere with lovely food .,2
i love this store .,2
this has been the worst stay of any hotel we 've stayed at .,2
went to vegas and found this gem !,2
my toes are still not dry .,2
they will check your bags for you for $ _num_ per bag .,2
outdoor seating with this weather is perfect .,2
lots of space and a fancy jacuzzi tub included .,2
this place is big and decorated beautifully .,2
i would choose the flamingo rather than harrahs .,2
vegas is n't exactly lacking expensive high quality restaurants .,2
i have to say that i really enjoyed my visit to this beautiful store .,2
please stay this fantastic .,2
mother of god this establishment is king of spam .,2
we enjoyed one of the best italian dinners ever here .,2
sangria pitchers make for a great meal .,2
service for good for the big group i was with .,2
"she is absolutely amazing , she made it as less painless as possible .",2
i am extremely dissatisfied with my experience and i want a full refund immediately .,2
nice bathrooms as well .,2
love the decor and the ambiance .,2
more then to deal with all this crap !,2
they only fixed what the eye could see .,2
they looked like off duty renaissance fair workers .,2
i love the layout of the store and always have a positive experience .,2
she is unhelpful rude and a bitch .,2
thank god we did !,2
and the pizzas here are as great as ever .,2
you 're better off paying a little more for a better buffet .,2
you can spend hours exploring !,2
i 'm thinking he just decided to blow me off .,2
we truly enjoyed this restaurant and i hope you do too .,2
the only ok thing was the garlic bread out of the whole meal !,2
customer service is great !,2
"we got great food , great drinks at great prices .",2
a little too greasy for me .,2
my drinks are always the right temperature and the proper recipe !,2
ordered a side of hash browns and got some work done on the computer .,2
a friend who lives here in vegas took me to this hidden gem .,2
great place and great food !,2
the sangria was also really good .,2
that is not easy here .,2
it probably took _num_ minutes to get to the desk .,2
came here with my girlfriend and enjoyed every minute of it .,2

recommend it for all kids .,2
i will continue coming back here .,2
my water glass always was full .,2
by far the most inspired and worthwhile meal i had while in las vegas .,2
a fun time to be had by all .,2
the bbq sauce and cheese was the only good stuff on it .,2
the service and overall experience was fantastic .,2
duck was wonderful and cooked to perfection .,2

it got to me .,2

they change their menu seasonally which is refreshing to try new menu options .,2
generally the hotel is n't too bad .,2
messed up my nails horribly & would n't refund my money .,2
i really enjoyed their salad of romaine with roasted salmon and unagi sauce .,2
the staff is beyond surly and rude .,2
this is truely a fantastic place .,2
ok hotel if you like empty promises .,2
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside .,2
the good is really good .,2
"price wise , not bad well worth it .",2
we 'll be back for happy hour next time !,2
the beef tacos were very good .,2
i do n't understand how four different servers all made this same basic mistake .,2
when we got to new rooms they were still disappointing .,2
the pool on the roof was expected to be a regular pool .,2
great food and atmosphere as usual .,2
she said this was what was missing .,2
i am so happy we found this company !,2
"makes excellent salads , salmon and pizza .",2
cheese dip is a great appetizer .,2
no counter space at all to set and alcohol or food or anything on .,2
french fries were good as well as their red sangria !,2
best adventure of the trip !,2
some of the best tapas i 've ever eaten .,2
_num_ out of the _num_ was good but nothing great .,2
the range is absolutely great and so where the people .,2
the prices are excellent .,2
the guy at the front desk said i could check in at that point .,2
"once they were dropped off , he came back to take our food order .",2
we rate the place less than a star !,2
once again it was pretty fun .,2
we ordered _num_ burgers : _num_ cali 's and _num_ veg .,2
the supposedly fresh oyster is not so fresh .,2
my wife and daughter truly enjoyed as well !,2

"food , service , style , elegance , class .",2
that was very nice .,2
beautiful clean room once again !,2
the steak itself was done in most parts - very pink in other parts .,2
very helpful and attentive staff as a bonus .,2
the service was just all around terrible .,2
i have not been here since and do not plan on going back .,2

she was absolutely amazing and so much fun to work with .,2
"for us , this was the best food we had in vegas .",2
i feel sorry for people who have wasted their money on this place .,2
please do n't order their ahi tuna skewers !,2
the food at the bar area was very good and the pricing very fair .,2
oh & the resort fee is a rip off .,2
our service was prompt and unobtrusive .,2
i came here with four friends on a monday night .,2
so it 's like modern vs throwback .,2
"i love pep boys normally , and i would use others .",2
he was so rude .,2
i do n't know how this place is _num_ 1/2 stars .,2
lovely setting as well .,2
"the drink is n't strong , but it tastes really good .",2
at this point my daughter was extremely upset and crying .,2
it was abysmal in every possible way .,2
she really cares about all of the children and makes you feel comfortable .,2
"our room was basic , which was to be expected .",2
a large group of us decided to go out here tonight .,2
nowhere on my receipts did it mention the $ _num_ .,2
telephone service which i did n't even use ?,2
the crab cakes were the best i ever had .,2
i really like this place .,2
not really a great place for kids not just the hotel but vegas period .,2
this is an every friday morning treat for us .,2
$ _num_ down the drain .,2
just make sure you do not get rooms with connecting doors .,2
"all in all , a pretty horrible experience .",2
no one else was using the self service however .,2
"otherwise , great happy hour find !",2
i paid for one of the remodeled rooms and it was a horrible experience .,2
you do n't see that very often .,2
this was not the case here .,2

i would never go back again .,2
i would never go back again .,2

and both my husband and i liked the food a lot .,2
please order the mojitos when you go there .,2
i will bet staying elsewhere next time .,2
"boyfriend was in love with the angus steak , cooked to perfection .",2
the calamari was also very well prepared .,2
it 's a waste of time and money .,2
she never gave me anything to replace it with either .,2
taco sampler is awesome .,2
the food was so greasy it was gross .,2
i always get the tall cup one .,2
always packed but for good reason .,2
their bathrooms are really nice too .,2
all the pieces of the rolls were literally falling apart .,2
furniture was falling apart .,2
upon arrival to my room the bathroom did n't have any bath towels .,2
"some items were a huge hit , and some things were just good .",2
( waiting since 11pm ) .,2
my bf is n't even a salad person but he loved it .,2
but i stayed calm and walked away .,2
the ambience is great despite the somewhat tacky props and decor .,2
so very unhappy with what i am experiencing at this hotel at this moment .,2
i had my wedding reception here and it was an amazing experience !,2
best dining experience in vegas yet !,2
currently sitting here for _num_ minutes waiting for my appointment .,2
there gluten free menu was very extensive and delicious !,2
it was n't as good as i expected .,2
coach is very expensive '' .,2
_num_ ) nasty pool .,2
the prices were great it 's a must try !,2
"they said ok , you just need to come down to the lobby .",2
the elevators are super slow .,2
beyond that ... it was a total dive .,2
i know places have bugs that us customers never see .,2
they had good promotions going on .,2
kinda cool in a vanilla sky kind of way .,2
the last 1/2 star is for the deep fried oreo .,2
another review from someone that has n't been impressed .,2
"but , if you 're a girl in vegas you will have fun .",2
their sangria 's are delicious !,2
they helped me understand everything about the gun before i bought it .,2
love this place ... .,2
he said it would cost too much to set a table just for dessert .,2
i 've never tried fatburger in my life .,2
the villa is dated .,2
the poker room card shuffle machines hardly work .,2
everything in this place is good .,2
i will not return to this dennys .,2
i enjoyed it and would probably do it again when i return to vegas .,2
first and foremost our room was clean .,2
"also , the cilantro rice is amazing .",2
he would n't even take it if it was in a plastic bag .,2
all of their food is fantastic and you 'll enjoy a fine dining experience .,2
"after they investigate , they told me door was not locked ( what ?",2
probably wo n't come back here again for a stay .,2
you will love the customer service and unlimited food and drinks .,2
will definitely be coming back here !,2
there is no in door seating just the outdoor patio so dress accordingly .,2
overall a bad experience .,2
sweet n spicy shrimp tasted chinese .,2
the ahi tuna salad was very blend .,2
"the room was just a basic king room , but the tv channels sucked .",2
"gourmet quality tapas , great for sharing !",2
plus his uni did n't look buttery fresh .,2
there is really nothing for them .,2
the decor is really pretty and romantic .,2
it has pretty good number of slot machines .,2
the staff is so friendly and helpful here .,2
the food choices are great and the quality excellent .,2
i checked & sure enough there still wet and smell horrible .,2
the lines are n't clean and the ink is n't consistent .,2
"the venetian boat ride is kinda expensive , but it 's pretty cool .",2
i 'm not really sure what the theme of this hotel is .,2
the thai beef salad is also really good !,2
"but to make matters worse , parking was horrible .",2
the tv had less channels than the free cable i get at home .,2
this was by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had .,2
it is nowhere worth $ _num_ .,2
"i got the jalapeno bagel with butter , and it was super delicious !",2
she said she would credit my card back for the missing items .,2
if she has it not she will order it and that makes me happy .,2
the initial experience at the lobby left a foul stench .,2
* happy hour is limited strictly to the bar area .,2

the hotel was clean and pretty easy to navigate .,2
great place to stay and its in the perfect location !,2
one of my favorite spots in vegas .,2
we will no come back .,2
the catered event had lots of fun foods to try as well as karaoke .,2
too pricey for the quality .,2
"my room was a standard room , and it was motel sized .",2
the service was impeccable !,2
but definitely worth the try .,2
simply stay away from this hotel .,2
this is pretty boring .,2
i like this place and with the right company it is a blast .,2
"bagel fresh , tasty , and full of sesame seeds .",2
definitely will make this my regular place .,2
totally unprofessional and uncaring to say the least .,2
i was nervous at first but dave made sure we were relaxed and comfortable .,2
they charge when additional rice is ordered .,2
the biggest standout was def the dates !,2
chips and salsa were delicious .,2
came back again with my girlfriend and it is as good as ever .,2
"the food was the best part , my favorite being the stuffed dates .",2
and probably not even doing their job .,2
everything in vegas is always amazing .,2
the couch did n't even belong in the goodwill .,2

the worst customer service ever .,2
"always delicious , never dissapointed .",2
( waiter tuxedo restaurant ) .,2

pay $ _num_ to $ _num_ for a better hotel on the strip ... .,2
do n't go here they waste ur time !,2
it does n't make any sense ?,2
i order roll that 's not to be spicy and it was very spicy .,2
atmosphere is a _num_ .,2
i loved my food at spago .,2
hands down best tapas i 've ever had !,2
for some reason my manager gave ya 'll a _num_ % discount !,2
"very careful , attentive , and pleasant staff really make a difference .",2
so much flavor to choose from !,2
a great bang for your buck !,2
the philly was stuffed to the rim and there was bacon in every bite .,2
i dont know what i was thinking expecting it from this restaurant .,2
even the restaurants within were terrible .,2
the service was as snooty as i remembered it .,2
the place has gone to hell since the mgm bought it .,2
their sangria and mojitos are also some of the best i 've ever had .,2
the cocktails are creative and delicious .,2
i had the best time at the beach !,2
so i 've been scammed twice by the excalibur .,2
"no selection , and unhappy and unhelpful sales people .",2
in the mardi gras floor the rooms are extremely dated .,2
do n't let the castle exterior fool you .,2
i found this very irritating .,2
the rooms are fine ; very small and the bed is a murphy bed .,2
the lines are long and the food it awful !,2
this is hands down the best italian food in the city .,2

the staff treated me very well and the bed was beyond comfortable .,2
super close to strip .,2
the service has been good to great every time i have been there .,2
this was the best of _num_ hotels we stayed at during our road trip .,2
custom orders are welcomed and they will ship anything anywhere !,2
"if it 's busy , it 's worth the wait .",2
they treat you so well here .,2
i would definitely eat here again .,2
the rooms were completely gross .,2
"if you are hungry , definitely order the pork barbacoa .",2
this place is a nice relaxed feel with live music .,2
they delivered new keys instead .,2
las vegas first timer !,2
he really pissed me off .,2
one of the best breakfasts and values in vegas .,2
that is n't an option on my mac .,2
you really get what you pay for here .,2
this is just dirty .,2
great off the strip tapas restaurant .,2
"nice place , love the tropical ambiance .",2
staff is very friendly .,2
the best way to start off your vegas trip !,2
"day _num_ , we found out the coffee maker was broken .",2
as far as i 'm concerned you should be very ashamed of your establishment !,2
the resort charge does n't get you anything either .,2
the service is good ; but the food is mediocre at best .,2
it 's awful awful awful .,2
"from the minute we walked into the resort , everything was pretty basic .",2
"positively delicious , every bite was perfection !",2
they have lost good customers tonight .,2
it has gone downhill perhaps more than any other mall in the valley .,2
your best off eating somewhere other than harrahs .,2
they said they could n't return them .,2
they were all very kind and helpful .,2
this place was great for my first -- but probably only -- time .,2
definitely a vegas favorite !,2
it tasted a little bland .,2
my first experience at the excalibur was not good not bad just okay .,2
"so i then said , `` nope , i 'm done thank you '' .",2
needs a remodel in a bad way .,2
the chopped salad was delish and it made me feel good about ordering it .,2

this was my first and last time at this restaurant .,2
had nice sunday lunch .,2
sushi is fresh and reasonably priced !,2
the staff are always friendly and knowledgeable .,2
our waiter was very good !,2
it had a very smooth almost creamy texture with some really great flavor .,2

in addition to this utter nonsense ?,2
the worst restaurant experience i have ever had .,2
the thai beef salad was okay .,2
my husband and i came here to gamble during our stay in las vegas .,2
our third course was scallops my absolute favorite at every restaurant except here .,2
explained everything to me well enough for me to understand .,2
rooms are old as well as old nasty carpet .,2
we will definitely go back the next time we are in vegas !,2
not sure if it 's really any better than the smoke itself .,2
ok - so far i 'm thinking we 're starting off right .,2
the waitress walked away from our table before we finished ordering .,2
the bread they offer is delicious as well .,2
one of the best restaurants in vegas !,2
love the caribbean theme !,2

night crowd is full of eye candy too !,2
"next time , i do n't think there will be one .",2

every filipino restaurant in new york gives a free order of rice per person .,2
and no cough drops .,2
all i can say is very very disappointed !,2

i do n't understand all the rave reviews .,2
ya ya ya i know wtf am i doing staying here .,2

hmmm maybe excalibur is this way on purpose .,2
very happy about that .,2
the buffet was totally disappointing .,2
"as for the `` baja fresh '' , was horrible .",2
"the flavors are overly complex , overly sweet and unimpressive .",2
the lost and found department closed sundays by 4pm .,2
"_num_ ) yes , you can print your boarding passes .",2

disgusting and filthy dirty carpets in the guest rooms .,2
their sangria is sooo good !,2
he 's got so much energy and has a great personality !,2
everything we tried was fantastic .,2
i would never bring my kids to vegas otherwise .,2
it 's totally worth it & i left full !,2
i stayed here the past month and did not like it at all .,2
service is always great here and today was no exception .,2
the other guest would have access to my room & would have came in .,2
this was a great hotel experience .,2
there were lots of good options .,2
"needless to say , great customer service can get you a fat sale .",2
it 's definitely worth it .,2
"smelly and musty , the rooms are old and made my clothing smell .",2
"instead of apologizing to us , they questioned us .",2
i figured how bad can it be ?,2

first of all the tv in the room was n't even working .,2
the staff at dr green 's office is awesome -- super friendly and accommodating .,2

the service is friendly and attentive .,2
"the casino is big , but is dated .",2
my first firefly experience was at the downtown location and it was amazing .,2
i would n't stay here again .,2

i could see the rat pack eating here and enjoying it .,2

i also love the burger for lunchtime .,2
"however , that said , the food was really good .",2
and the burger is worse now .,2

i love the ambience of this place !,2
food is so fun and delicious .,2
he was very friendly and knowledgeable about eh menu .,2
black mold under the sink and on the cabinet .,2
the rooms are decent .,2
this year was a little different and we probably wo n't be back .,2
but the best part about this place is the atmosphere .,2
i went here after reading all the yelp reviews .,2
they make you laugh and offer drinks you may like .,2
then the real fun starts !,2
it is worth the wait !,2
both were the best i 've ever had .,2
pitchers of sangria and mojitos were good .,2
true the decor is beyond tacky .,2

the salesman did n't even offer me a test drive .,2
"the barbacoa is fantastic , incredibly tender .",2
a time piece for everyone .,2
there are n't a lot of great restaurants .,2
the waitress was just as bad as the hostess - rude rude rude .,2
we have visited less and less because of it .,2
our lobster came still half alive ... slimy and not cooked .,2
the busser was a better `` waiter '' than our actual waiter .,2
buffet is nothing to write home about .,2
"their drinks are fun , strong , and tasty .",2
great for a girls night or a date night .,2
it tasted almost rotten .,2
the fries are so good .,2
i enjoyed eating lunch here .,2
it 's a very warm atmosphere and i highly recommend it .,2
the only upside is there are $ _num_ tables .,2
is n't this what we paid $ _num_ for ?,2
i just love this place .,2
i just love this place .,2
and she almost ordered the wrong photos because of her lack of attention .,2
i would never eat there again and would probably not stay there either .,2
by far one of the best lunch places i have been to .,2
"super modern white design , but still cosy and not too big .",2
reservations are a must as the place fills up with mostly the younger crowd .,2
flatbread had no flavor .,2
"poor quality , even for a denny 's .",2
we were in vegas for my birthday and a co-worker recommended this place .,2
food was tasty and margaritas were refreshing .,2
this place is awesome !,2
this place is awesome !,2
this place is awesome !,2
this place is awesome !,2
i could not understand why dirty linens were folded and stocked on the cart .,2
"fun , affordable , and tasty .",2
the tables are hit or miss and the amount of smoke is ridiculous .,2
"i had high hopes for this diner , i wish it had been better .",2
the human food is well-priced .,2
"find a hotel with parking security , saves you more money in the end .",2
ridiculous how unprofessional he was .,2
the real problem is the restaurant itself .,2
the best dinner so far in las vegas .,2
i will never come back here and will recommend ppl avoid this place !,2
somehow they managed to mess this one up .,2
the chicken fingers were typical frozen chicken .,2
we have had a bad experience since day one at this hotel .,2
also good for kids with arcade and shows .,2
the price was incredibly reasonable for the caliber of meal you get too !,2
anita is a very nice and attentive server .,2
overall we had a great time here !,2
either way it does the body right !,2
it was fine for one night but i will not stay there again .,2
good food n fast .,2
i was hoping for a truly legendary cheese steak experience .,2
i love everything about this place .,2
enjoyed the rest of it in the morning in the hotel room .,2
will come back again and again .,2
but this location is very dirty .,2
i would 've really had been pissed if we were sat facing a wall .,2
they have tasty breakfasts at a far more reasonable price than the strip .,2
hubby 's grandma had the seafood chowder and loved it .,2
staff is very helpful and friendly .,2
"also : vegas is not disney , folks .",2
here comes the biggest problem ... .,2
the food as expected is superb .,2
"too thick and not much flavor , other than the gorgonzola on top .",2
this is a must when you go to las vegas !,2
dumb move we left him in the room & went out on the town .,2
"did n't stay at harrah 's , but loved gambling there .",2
the calamari and tuna were really amazing .,2
not coming back ever again .,2
they do n't even deserve _num_ star .,2
they were tasteless and smelled like old beef .,2
it 's fun to win prizes here .,2
no fridge in the room .,2
this was not explained to us and is a huge rip off .,2
this place was such a disappointment on so many levels .,2
hotel hell should come to this place and help them .,2
the rating is solely based on experience with the general manager - mike wong .,2
the service was fast and friendly as well .,2
the bed and furniture could be more comfortable .,2
definitely not a way to end your trip .,2
all the flavors here are equally fantastic so pick anything .,2
great time with the kids ... .,2
staff was friendly and helpful .,2
staff was friendly and helpful .,2
"dear ross , can i please have the sale price ?",2
"seriously , i do .",2
checking in earlier costs money - $ _num_ .,2
higher tier rooms are of better quality .,2
view over the strip was nice .,2
`` yea and can i get one for my girlfriend too ?,2
good times ... love them drinks !,2
i always recommend firefly on paradise .,2
great little people watching spot to boot .,2
i wish employees would be more friendly and open to the guests .,2
consistency in food preparation does not exist between locations .,2
a great place for a late night dinner .,2
the scallops are amazing and everyone must have the beet salad .,2
all in all we will be back !,2
my appointment was at _num_ o'clock .,2
"honestly , i would never pick excalibur to stay at .",2
it was really loud and crowded .,2
a fun and easy way to go between parts of the vegas strip .,2
it has great appetizers .,2
the service is so good at spago .,2
the girl who helped us check in was very helpful .,2
just want to qualify my review before i get into it .,2
i thought it was fine .,2
my eye shadow was beautiful !,2
"oh , no wifi either .",2
i went to las vegas for a small valentines getaway with my boyfriend .,2
the wait time happened twice .,2
do n't risk staying here no matter how good the deal is !,2
almost like they just did n't care ?,2
especially love the late night happy hour !,2
i called guest services and they were really rude to me about it .,2
i walked in with very specific requirements for new work shoes .,2
gave us great recommendations on sushi and saki .,2
excalibur did not live up to expectation .,2
"um , the lamp still has a pull down string to turn it on .",2
are you kidding me ?,2
are you kidding me ?,2
are you kidding me ?,2
are you kidding me ?,2
are you kidding me ?,2
stayed here a few years ago and it was horrible .,2
the food itself was very tasty .,2
so would n't i just be able to build a margherita pizza ?,2
a little pricey but well worth it !,2
i will definitely go back ... wish they had this place in ca .,2
a good business hotel .,2
another typical bad sign is when you ca n't order directly from the chef .,2
was pleasantly surprised by large drink and food menu .,2
it was a great deal and nights not available to the public .,2
a lovely employee ignored and walked past by us .,2
i have been here maybe _num_ times .,2
they also have amazing cocktails .,2
"love , love , love this place .",2
lousy atmosphere and sketchy cooks .,2
good food with a great atmosphere !,2
this is a good deal !,2
this restaurant should be called rice rolls _num_ not sushi _num_ .,2
that guy is just incredible !,2
that comes out to $ _num_ .,2
"i would come back , as long as i do n't have him again .",2
i think the hotel staff should put an application in to work there .,2
we wanted to take a nap after we checked in .,2
the food was pretty disgusting .,2
"the food at the buffet was mediocre , but had a large selection .",2
but my last trip to mac was outstanding .,2
made me utterly sick .,2
this place has sandwiches that are overpriced and is drowned in cheese whiz .,2
i would never stay there again .,2
best way to get around vegas to the premier stops you want to make .,2
i was there for two hours and only _num_ other shoppers .,2
"got the octane one , and it was strong but not too strong !",2
sent it back and came back less salty .,2
the rice was dry and had a salty after taste .,2
these guys are great !,2
i do n't think i 'll bother going back to this store again .,2
avoid at all costs unless you are drunk .,2
"friendly , funny , and helpful , it was an excellent shopping experience !",2
the service was phenomenal .,2
the lady was very rude and tried to get me off the phone .,2
also rooms a little worn .,2
the tar tar was absolutely delicious i recommend that item first and foremost .,2
the owners are super cool .,2
i have received no phone call or e mail and its been _num_ weeks .,2
wine was superb as was the service .,2
i 'd rather pay more money for a better experience .,2
i am totally disappointed that this is what the new harrahs has become .,2
to think we were sleeping on that is disgusting !,2
my feet are really rough as i am a runner .,2
absolutely love this place !,2
"a bit pricey , but worth it .",2
we had rob as our instructor and he was great !,2
in spite of casino 's low rating i really enjoyed this casino .,2
"as far as casino hotels in vegas go , this is one of them .",2
"i highly recommend the dates , empanadas , and chorizo stuffed mushrooms !",2
every aspect was amazing .,2
not up to my standards especially since i work in the industry .,2
the bathroom had poor water pressure .,2
not to mention the huge arcade downstairs !,2
"like i say , getting in and out of there now is a nightmare .",2
you got ta give it a try .,2
thank you for your great hospitality and service .,2
everything tastes freshly made .,2
by far the worst service i 've ever experienced during a stay in vegas .,2
the customer service here was outstanding .,2
preferred the flamingo from previous trip .,2
"all her over services are great too , lol .",2
"primo , i 'm not a fan of carpets where you serve food .",2
most likely will not be coming here again .,2
had a lot of delicious food here .,2
we will return the next time we are in vegas !,2
this has to be the worst place in vegas .,2
sad to say i will never book another reservation thru hotels.com ever .,2
the arcade smelled like mildew & made me want to gag .,2
food quality is average at best preparation completely uneven .,2
"casino is ok , everything is just out dated .",2
i love this hotel ... .,2
worth the trip from the strip .,2
"we ordered _num_ different tapas , as well as alcoholic beverages .",2
this is a casual mexican place inside the venetian hotel .,2
"their prices are outstanding , and the service is awesome !",2
after the second course i asked my waiter when does my wine pairing start .,2
i 'm hard pressed to remember service as bad i experienced at this hotel .,2
great beds great staff .,2
horrible place nobody go here .,2
the smell of smoke was everywhere .,2
they recommended pistachio and i enjoyed it .,2
the one underground at the mgm was great .,2
not welcoming at all .,2
this was my favorite meal in vegas .,2
room was nice as well as free wifi and free breakfast .,2

i am so put out with this place .,2
it is a great place for children to win toys and adults to gamble .,2
and he made sure i had a comfortable and delicious meal .,2
the food was surprisingly pretty good .,2
smelled like smoke when no smoking room .,2
we left somewhat disappointed .,2
no one was there !,2
fantastic food at any hour love this place !,2
thank you for a great start to the day !,2
this place has really gone downhill since i last stayed here .,2
the food was nothing special .,2
my biggest problem was the room .,2
i have n't been here in years - the food and service was great .,2
pizza hut or any national chain has better pizza based fare than this place .,2
i had the house stromboli and my wife had chicken wings and fries .,2
"service was impeccable , very fast and friendly .",2
"unless you have kids , no .",2
she should n't even have one to begin with .,2
"as most of vegas , the hotel smells like smoke .",2
i was highly offended that as my server she could n't communicate with us .,2
they really provide top-notch services .,2
thank you so much !,2
thank you so much !,2

i was there for _num_ hours .,2
we will be staying here next time !,2
next time i 'll bring my own polish and tools though .,2
the mood is pretty chill .,2
great food in small and very affordable .,2
"request waiter adrian , he 's very caring and has great customer service .",2
they also had too much salt in their batter or seasoning .,2
bathrooms get overcrowded and filthy inside like a college football game .,2
improving gambling and comps would make you more competitive .,2
"we ordered a lamb sandwich , a pizza , and a chopped salad .",2
and yes another kid friendly place !,2
slow service but semi professional .,2
with excellent service and reasonable prices .,2
wow the food was amazing the sliders !,2
definitely one of the more touristy things about vegas .,2
i will never stay or even enter this hotel again .,2
that 's not my issue .,2
i really enjoyed myself .,2
i enjoyed my experience here with my girlfriend .,2
that goes to show their still misleading customers .,2
this is really a must have for a day in vegas !,2
half yard _num_ with an add shot .,2
"although the rates are good , i just spent three nights there .",2
"the room was an upgrade , but only in the tv and granite counters .",2
the problem remains is that the entire tower _num_ needs to be renovated .,2
do n't expect anything remotely good from this place .,2
we just stayed _num_ nights at this hotel .,2
looks great with the remodel !,2
i think any toddler is familiar with the difference between crackers and bread .,2
got same reception when we checked out on monday .,2
best recommended for a hungry night and special occasion dining .,2
the shelves and racks are empty .,2
the pictures are horribly overpriced and you are forced to buy a package .,2
the carpet is dirty and worn out the fixtures are also old and worn .,2
the staff was superb and the food was really good .,2
helped me out with everything i needed & was super friendly .,2
the food here was good and unique !,2
"i ordered delivery , my food showed up missing items .",2
most vegas establishments have great service .,2
being from nyc it 's really hard to find a good bagel out here !,2
the stole my mother in laws purse and my daughters purse .,2
if u gamble do n't waste ur money to any total rewards casino !,2
the risotto was watery and too salty .,2
thoroughly disgusted with their pathetic hotel and security staff .,2
proximity to the strip was n't bad .,2
we had a party of _num_ ; _num_ adults and _num_ children .,2
"its dirty , and smelly the moment you walk in .",2
drinks are pretty strong ... especially the mojito .,2
"so yeah , i ca n't recommend specific dishes because i like them all .",2
he just threw to my husband 's hands and immediately walked away .,2
"couple people ordered a special salmon , which was great as well .",2
the classic salad was unique in that it had so many vegetable finely chopped .,2
it was that bad !,2
it did n't disappoint !,2
my friends meatball sandwhich was cold .,2
he was so knowledgable of the area and kept us entertained .,2
i had a great experience and was in and out in a flash .,2
i ca n't believe it .,2
poor delivery and preparation for this event definitely gives this place _num_ star .,2
the hotel itself is n't too bad .,2
first time here with my wife .,2
it was n't enough for us to stay again .,2
i did n't even get an apology which is so crazy .,2
the food was overpriced and not very tasty .,2
our servers were perfect .,2
i get this happens and we get into our room .,2
"they told me to speak to a hotel manager , yet none were available .",2
there are two empty tables next to us .,2
"great atmosphere , right by the canal .",2
the place has been around awhile and is pretty dated .,2
it 's a pretty nice arcade with a good number of choices .,2
and they have awesome sangria !,2
good location for strip visitors .,2
helped me find just the right thing ... the boyfriend jeans .,2
food is also very good .,2
soaked in hot sauce and served on foam plates .,2
i do n't recommend .,2
"good atmosphere , amazing happy hour and staff are friendly too .",2
my room did n't have an internet cable .,2
having said that i am sorely disappointed in this arby 's .,2
all of the dishes were perfectly seasoned and i would definitely recommend this place !,2
they have free breakfast which is good .,2
pros : beds were comfortable and cheap .,2
it was such a horrible and disgusting experience !,2
jason gave us top notch service -- something we have come to expect .,2
the store is well organized & pretty quiet when i was there .,2
great way to spend time with friends ringing in the new year .,2
"not just great food , but great people !",2
love the mid strip location with the monorail stop .,2
again i experienced a well prepared meal here at bahama breeze !,2
the price is the only thing this place has going for itself .,2
i called and called and they said no no nope .,2
was n't so happy & excited .,2
around the same price so i wo n't be staying here again .,2
"it 's an old hotel , so i was n't expecting much .",2
the theme was just so ridiculous .,2
great location in the forum shops and all of the food smelled amazing .,2
"i love mgm properties , but this place is garbage !",2
"she sent me to the platinum line , where i still had to wait .",2
bacon wrapped dates stuffed with almonds and blue cheese - wow !,2
i was n't expecting mgm style .,2
i enjoyed riding the monorail .,2
do n't waste your time or money !,2
"fourth , the food itself was quite mediocre , at best .",2
"also , there is someone trying to sell you something every _num_ feet !",2
i do not like their nasty restroom !,2
nice selection of exotic tropical cocktails .,2
highly recommend and def have the martini !,2
overall this place just needs to go away .,2
i was happy all right .,2
"the food , when i finally ate it was n't that good .",2
the room was spacious and there was nothing wrong .,2
she is the worst doctor i 've seen .,2
personally i do not recommend this place for the price .,2
this place does n't even come close .,2

but our other coworker did not .,2
"manager was rude , grumpy and unapologetic .",2
the pool area is small but really nice .,2
"overall , harrah 's is a terrible hotel .",2
the ambiance brings it all together : ) wonderful find outside of the strip .,2
they were unable to put sheets on our bed .,2
made me lose my appetite .,2
i like the concept of the castle but not the way they executed it .,2
"very old vegas , love it !",2
no agent would ever break a rule ! '',2
the food here is great ... i loved almost everything we ordered .,2
you get great service from the bartender .,2
this is the perfect place to work on giving out a fake name .,2
service was friendly but so-so .,2

and yet i do n't care i refuse to wait in line any longer .,2
the dessert menu was superb .,2
they have an amazing selection of things .,2
the checkin was about _num_ people -- it was insane !,2
excellent margaritas ( just say you do n't want it sweet ) .,2
this may be my favorite banana of them all .,2
the roll did n't even taste all the fresh at all .,2
rainbow trout can definitely use some assistance with seasoning .,2
probably the best thing we did on our trip .,2

everything we had was so good !,2
great location and i love gambling at the casino .,2
she was rude and just so cold .,2
"everything is good , but i had the bacon wrapped dates which were amazing !",2
all of these items were brand new .,2

thanks for the great service alex !,2
the best hospital to give birth in las vegas .,2
"i understand thorough , but thorough can be done quickly .",2
their sangria was also pretty amazing .,2
most expensive dining experience ever .,2
carrie from graveyard is the best !,2
unless you are on a very low budget and every other hotel is booked .,2
highly recommend a room above the casino .,2
they have a great weekday happy hour .,2
and my comforter had a cigarette burn on it .,2
one of my favorite extras for my sandwich as well as chipotle sauce !,2
the burritos were humongous and delicious and the chicken enchiladas were amazing !,2

i love tapas and this place had a great selection and atmosphere .,2
the towels were clean but the beds were horrible !,2
"finally , i flagged down a busboy and asked for the check .",2
this is n't going to be a positive post .,2
they 're practically adult drinks with a childhood twist .,2
the casino was n't anything to write home about .,2
"oh good lord , this place has n't changed in ages .",2
this was n't just our problem .,2
one of my favorite dishes here is the quesadilla ( see attached photo ) .,2
"the thermostat did n't do an actual , comfortable temperature .",2
"if you 're in vegas , do n't stay here .",2

"no coffee maker , not even glasses so we could drink .",2
"ok , the casino is not that great .",2
these touches are the nice cherry on top of an amazing dining experience .,2
wine recommended by our server was perfect for our snack .,2
the room was so small and so was everything else in the room .,2
you can always catch us in store or ordering our latest online .,2

"also , the cleaning lady did n't do anything but give us new towels .",2
"( i 'm from vegas , we 're special kind of people . )",2

but they pretty much ruined my christmas eve .,2
family and adult friendly .,2
and no one mentioned to compensate us !,2
"with that said , that was some good italian food .",2
i never knew mexican food can be so varied and exotic .,2
it serves its purpose in life !,2
"it 's wednesday , and i have n't got anything from them .",2
definitely worth the trip .,2
the most musty stale smell ever !,2
"very disappointing , excalibur , very disappointing .",2

everything was pretty tasty especially my favorite mac & cheese .,2

not fond of sangria but theirs is the best .,2
perhaps one of the most fun shopping experiences i 've ever had .,2
it just felt blah inside .,2
they wanted to charge me _num_ as if i was getting a discount .,2
this is not a trustworthy or honest business .,2
one may not notice .,2
omg the drink rocked !,2
"that said , the customer service is appalling .",2
one of my favorite restaurants in vegas !,2
that sauce they are cooked in is absolutely amazing .,2

my goodness is this place run terribly .,2
"this place has character and class , i will be back !",2

in the forum and definetly worth it .,2
the only good part was the crepes made to order !,2
it is fine if you do n't really know food .,2
the only thing i liked about this hotel was the casino and location .,2

this is an awesome restaurant .,2
firefly has possibly the best sangria i 've had in my entire life !,2
the room was dark and gave out a `` haunted '' feelings .,2
i stayed in tower _num_ a few months ago and the elevators were dirty .,2
"come on now , that 's just unacceptable !",2
very unappetizing to see .,2
i have n't stayed here since i was a child .,2
_num_ octane and hurricane mixed is amazing .,2
plus they still had plenty of breakfast food left .,2
"cheap , feels dirty , and quality is just not there .",2
food is great and always professional and courteous thru out the process .,2
there is a tv in the restroom but no remote for it .,2
facing the other tower .,2
even the bread was fantastic .,2
the best place to have dinner .,2
he explained the different watches and their materials with lots of knowledge and detail .,2
you can eat here and drink and still have money to gamble .,2
did not contest the sign on the door .,2
the work put into it is just amazing .,2
at least in a motel you get a real bed .,2
very nice place to grab a lunch .,2
"the casino smell so bad , the cigarette smoke was terrible .",2
the room i was sent to was already damaged .,2
there were _num_ other cars behind me !,2
the food was really good and the service was great .,2
"sit down , little boys and girls and let me tell you a story .",2
"perfect place to relax with soothing live music , delicious food and great cocktails .",2
i would recommend everyone trying this out for something unique to do .,2
one of my favorite restaurants in vegas .,2
$ _num_ for a drink and he wanted to charge me for a refill .,2
you must eat here if you love food and fun .,2
everything is going to crap now !,2
i was so excited to try this las vegas landmark .,2
my next step with this is complaining to each casino about this company .,2
i booked his hotel for my first visit to vegas .,2
my family of _num_ had a great time .,2
see my other yelp under forum shops !,2
could have been a bit better in price .,2
_num_ stars : best flautas in the world !,2
the service personnel in this hotel also had bad attitudes .,2
the chowder was excellent .,2
what an overall bad experience .,2
"warning , i am going to write a book .",2
not spending my money at a place like that .,2
you made our dinner a great experience !,2
"service started out a bit spotty , but got better as we settle in .",2
"honestly , this is probably my favorite restaurant in the world .",2
so i really really really wanted a philly cheese steak tonight .,2
i wish i was exaggerating - but i 'm not .,2
they made such a small request seem like a huge inconvenience .,2
best transportation for your $ $ $ .,2
room is outdated and not properly cleaned .,2
stopped by with friends for lunch .,2
a very good restaurant .,2
everything was delicious and the service was good .,2
mojitos are good too .,2
it 's the best thing ever .,2
a lot to be desired .,2
us wigs has a vast selection of blonde wigs which i really like .,2
it 's worth every minute .,2
the shoes and socks are very reasonable and the help is very good .,2
the hotel does n't look that great or fancy from the outside .,2
all of which were exceptional ) .,2
i thoroughly enjoyed the ambience and food and will definitely return .,2
"easy access , parking , clean and spacious rooms and free breakfast .",2
let 's not forget the crappy food choices !,2
this port of subs is great .,2
i also could n't help but notice that everything was n't freshly prepared .,2
is lettuce not in season ?,2
so check them out !,2
"stayed at harrahs last weekend , the beds were amazing !",2
we took our kids and we all had a blast !,2

this is one of the best hidden gems in vegas .,2
"when i had eaten all i could , there was still alot left over .",2
this is a great place for a date .,2
said it 's a `` reasonable '' italian place with great food .,2
i highly recommend this shop .,2
this is one of the best places i have eaten in las vegas .,2
now i remember why i do n't try new places .,2
every course was nicely presented and taste great .,2
the smoked salmon pizza was the perfect breakfast/lunch combo .,2
my car was not cleaned at all .,2
it 's a total shame that the hotel does this .,2
my favorite happy hour in las vegas .,2
i ended up drinking almost an entire pitcher last time i went !,2
i actually enjoyed my stay here .,2
this place is awesome for the taste and the deal !,2
the first thing i noticed was that she orders lots of tests .,2
only old school cable internet .,2
it is n't available after _num_ p.m .,2
but the drinks contained almost no alcohol .,2
over-priced food and an overall lack of caring .,2
the staff in the office was crap .,2
i 'm very happy with their service .,2
the food came in big portions and was delicious .,2
"boy , was i wrong !",2
we were so close to everything and that is exactly what we wanted .,2
go a couple times a year whenever in town .,2
it was so bad that even the dessert was horrible .,2
"great waitstaff , attentive , not pushy .",2

best food i had in vegas my whole trip .,2
wife enjoyed the curry shrimp .,2
i felt so beautiful !,2

the food was so good and the waiter was super nice .,2
clean shop but we walked out b/c of the owner .,2
"the people are great , very comfortable , homely atmosphere , very welcoming .",2
"omg , i really dont know how these guys are still in business .",2
beef dishes - especially sirloin are very good .,2
_num_ ) where is the wifi ?,2
toys r us has gone down the hole over the years .,2
"it 's fast , it 's convenient , and it 's easy !",2
"entree 's came out during salads , waters were empty and staff was absent .",2
this is the last time i 'll choose to pickup at this store .,2
just really really loudly ... .,2
newer casinos have bathrooms placed better along the gaming floor .,2
"`` sorry , are we bothering you ? ''",2
"overall , i enjoyed my stay .",2
yes yes the real caesar 's palace ... in las vegas at least .,2
"i had a great time at circus circus , the rooms are priced accordingly .",2
and the crowd is pretty great !,2
i 'll keep this short and sweet .,2
no wifi offered either .,2
their signature firefly fries are a bit greasy but quite tasty .,2
ended up staying here as my original vacation date changed due to work .,2
great people watching for sure .,2
but oh well ... to each is own .,2
another thing that has become really irritating is the endless sales pitch .,2
"wasnt impressed this time cheese burger overcooked and dry , fries cold .",2
the food is always fresh and of quality .,2
the gentleman said he still did n't have any other rooms available .,2
chunks of fresh lobster meat rolled in a delicate homemade pasta .,2
my bath towel smelled like smoke .,2
my bath towel smelled like smoke .,2
do not stop there late in the evening .,2
"as has been mentioned before , no wifi either .",2
stuffy is the word for it .,2
makes me never want to go back .,2
very good mexican restaurant .,2
we love this place and we highly recommend to everyone !,2
love the jalapeo bagel here !,2
"we 're waiting , and he brings out luggage that is n't ours !",2

a little bowl of canned veg all and a stale roll .,2
"it is korean owned , and not authentic japanese sushi .",2
this is the worse pizza i 've ever eaten .,2
easy cab ride from the strip .,2
best i can say is disappointing overall .,2

i do n't know why i keep coming in these stores .,2
"we had great service , the bartenders were very attentive and friendly .",2
"the temperature said it was _num_ , but it felt like _num_ .",2
"okay - other than that , there 's really nothing to see .",2
"i love places with a great happy hour , atmosphere , and patio .",2
she only had _num_ tables so not quite sure why that took so long .,2
virtually every person was displeased with their room in one way or another .,2
thank you for all you did for my son .,2
i also recommend the house made infused vodka on the rocks .,2
the food is just perfect !,2
"no lie , best drink in vegas !",2
pricing is as good as it gets as well for all the different sizes .,2
"and some fishy paste , blah !",2
the food is amazing .,2
the food is amazing .,2
"oh , and if you want to enjoy the pool - it sucks .",2
nothing fancy - but the location is perfect !,2
salad was very good best part was the croutons .,2
they make you feel very comfortable and help you have a good time .,2
"overall , this hotel is a great deal .",2
but otherwise i try to avoid it if at all possible .,2
and do n't get me started about saturday night at the casino .,2
"really , truly gorgeous .",2
"the smells are just different ; coffee , as opposed to the woods .",2
"they are fast , efficient and fair on rice .",2
"i 'll be back for sure , though .",2
"however , i tried something new ... and it was great !",2
they were not happy .,2

there are two hotel towers .,2
"overall , it was n't the worst i could have imagined .",2
sad how poor management can ruin a location .,2
drinks and food were great !,2
the room itself to me seemed a little dated .,2
only complaint is the nose level was quite high .,2

it was the perfect place to grab lunch .,2
it is the best i 've ever had .,2
the food was amongst the best we have ever had .,2
loved the bed selection as well !,2

"good food , great ambiance and excellent margaritas .",2

the mushrooms were wonderful .,2
letting me get even more mad about the situation .,2

the beef is so juicy and tender it literally melts off the fork .,2
our check was handed by another server .,2

we decided to grab a fast bite at the food court .,2
i got _num_ full size beds in a smoking room .,2

our friends ' room was less than clean .,2
there wasnt even a bathtub in this upgraded room .,2

the instructors are superb !,2
i do n't think it is in the best part of town .,2
it was delicious with just the right amount of liquor .,2

it 's really not that great anymore .,2
great for a family or people on budget .,2
iv never been treated so badly .,2
"seriously , that bad .",2
the rooms are nice and clean .,2
but this one has the worst service !,2
they were both fantastic .,2
their drink selection is quite special .,2
i wish i could give zero stars .,2
this is a restaurant that is a must go to when in vegas !,2
my husband loved it .,2
sandwich was super soggy and not enjoyable .,2
this place is phenomenal !,2
this place is phenomenal !,2
get that extra shot for $ _num_ ; it 's worth it .,2
they have a happy hour ; ) and save room for dessert !,2
"it 'll be okay , she 'll deserve it .",2
great option for the regular more pricier service offered on the hotels .,2
"i put oil back in my car , and guess what ?",2
the waitress asked me what was wrong and i explained to her the situation .,2

everything here was awful !,2
the property is dated .,2

"i highly recommend the hotel , since i had an amazing experience .",2
"of $ _num_ per day , during the week .",2
"the food the first time was okay , philly cheese with swiss .",2
"unfortunately , i really did n't like my stay .",2
you can tell they really pay attention to detail .,2
go to that one unless you like excessive waiting .,2
avoid it at all cost !,2
but he was very offensive to us .,2
"i waited about _num_ days , and no one called .",2
"that being said , this is a great place .",2
slow to get drinks .,2
i only played poker but the experience was n't that great .,2
the elevator entrance reeked of a less than sanitary odor .,2
should be no star .,2
want a $ _num_ computer ?,2
do not eat the food off the grill here .,2
"good prices , service , atmosphere , and taste .",2
even they looked like they enjoyed working the place .,2
they were both really good .,2
however today my burger was more like a slider .,2
the salad is the best chinese chicken salad that you will eat .,2
the omelet came with a bagel and diced potatoes .,2
the decor was awful and reminded of a bad nail salon in the hood .,2
"clean , quiet , speedy .",2
the food was great - we started off with the steak tartar .,2
also the traffic can be a nightmare with a big convention .,2
"anyway , on with the review .",2

not impressed considering i 'm staying in a castle ... !,2
the food is so delicious and perfectly sized portions .,2
this will not fly with locals .,2
the door nearly hit the toilet when you would close it .,2

they have an awesome menu as well that has something for just about everyone .,2
service is okay but do n't expect much from such a casual place .,2
not a fan of this particular location .,2
worst customer service i have ever ever witnessed .,2
do n't waist your time or money with these people .,2

the prices per night are very good anytime of the year .,2
this is the first time i stayed in an older vegas hotel .,2
our first room was nasty .,2

best deal in vegas by far for what you get .,2
lol it needs to be remodeled .,2

they also have the best variety on their menu .,2

thank you sunrise l & d !,2
service from the two female bartenders was excellent as well .,2
not impressed at all with this place and i will not be back .,2

the room was just ok .,2
"after suggesting a free upgrade for his birthday , i was rudely shot down .",2
the food was really good and properly cooked .,2
very impressed with this apple location .,2

"i 'm normally not a meatloaf person , but it was fantastic .",2
the salmon entre was over _num_ dollars and it was dry and tasteless .,2
will definitely be coming back !,2
will definitely be coming back !,2
most of the fun and activities will be had in between these two hotels .,2
told my husband to hit the rain locker because he stunk .,2
the hotel refused to change my room without any sort of upgrades unfortunately .,2
i normally tip even for just picking up food from a restaurant but this time.,2
restaurant was clean and i saw the bus boys cleaning .,2
_num_ small stromboli and _num_ antipasto salad please .,2
the food is always consistent and the service is always great .,2
pathetic is one word to describe this hotel .,2
it looked so bad after she painted it .,2
waiter was extremely nice ; very polite and gave great recommendations !,2
"but , it was worth it .",2
great place to have a good small portioned meal with a lady .,2
i would certainly eat here again .,2
this hotel also has the worst dining on the strip .,2
the yard dog was the perfect size .,2
"always great service - quick service , and very friendly and attendant staff .",2
the price is great and the memories are plentiful .,2
service was also super polite and friendly both in the restaurant and bakery side .,2
i went to use the outlet to charge my phone .,2
this restaurant has a very hit and trendy environment .,2
"okay , just about everything on the menu , i enjoy good food .",2
wo n't be going back there again .,2
wo n't be back .,2
wo n't be back .,2
that 's just horrible management and customer service !,2
"customer service from the counter was superb , and the place was spotless .",2
it was nice to eat somewhere off the strip !,2
she had never tried any of the food .,2
would not pay to eat or gamble there .,2
dessert was the best .,2
great clothes and customer service to match !,2
i wish i could give a better review .,2
oh and do n't forget ... bring your own coffee maker !,2
to my surprise the food was exceptional .,2
this hotel is made for a nice long weekend .,2
they let you sample the drinks before purchasing and the staff is super friendly !,2
the burrito was really tasty .,2
never again will i stay in this horror place !,2
"pee in the toilet , towels on the floor .",2
excellent selection and tastes awesome .,2
all the staff from check in to photos we friendly and helpful .,2
the poker room sucked .,2
it 's still really nice .,2
highly recommended to anyone and every - delicious !,2
all that we ordered was delicious and we did n't break the bank .,2
sliders were mediocre and a little overdone for my taste .,2
"not a good vibe , kinda prison feel .",2
it is fast and efficient .,2
"no internet , noisy crappy conditioner , no ventilation in the rooms .",2
this was a very rush job .,2
the management agreed it was disgusting and yet did nothing about it .,2
they are the best !,2
but this does not compare to being scammed twice by the excalibur .,2
the empanadas and tuna tartare were amazing !,2
price is very reasonable as well .,2
"just let me walk to the pool in peace , please !",2
it was like _num_ bucks so i had high expectations .,2
i immediately called guest services and requested a room change .,2
the drinks are great and the servers are always friendly !,2
this is one of my favorite places to eat !,2
great experience overall and well worth .,2
i wo n't be making this my go to cheap hotel ever again .,2
staff is courteous fun and knowledgeable .,2
all were very good .,2
all were very good .,2
luckily i fell under the _num_ day with my lease .,2
parking for the apple store is best in the green area under saks .,2
the air conditioner cover was busted off .,2
it was so irritating .,2
great experience and so fun !,2
food tasted good and decor is elegant yet hip .,2
worst food in history of las vegas buffet .,2
"i saw a women fighting with manager for that issue , which was useless .",2
it 's a shame that the bus boy had to do all the work .,2
dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with .,2
always get the extra shot ... so worth it .,2
the view is terrible .,2
"overall , an average dessert and i 've had better .",2
room was nice and clean !,2
best italian i have ever had .,2
so you wo n't be getting these crappy reviews .,2
within five seconds another tech at the store was able to locate it .,2
this is the place to go if you like a good frozen cocktail !,2
each time is same star .,2
service here is always spot on and much appreciated !,2
( a room across the hall also complained of stolen items ) .,2
the week i was in vegas they had the computer system down twice .,2
great selection for inexpensive wigs .,2
the food was fantastic .,2
"really attentive staff , incredible food !",2
did n't feel that clean or anything .,2
i will definitely dine here again when i return to vegas !,2
i have been a vegas regular for many years now .,2
old and ugly rooms .,2
check in line goes pretty quick but the actual process is slow .,2
is that how this problem is resolved ?,2
"the casino seems dark , smokey , and old .",2
i stayed during labor day weekend the price was good .,2
this will be a regular visit every time we come to vegas .,2
that is the biggest bull crap i have ever heard .,2
definitely an interesting crowd depending on what you 're looking for .,2
she said i have to buy a empty cup for $ _num_ !,2
"service is fabulous , people watching is fun when sitting in the cafe .",2
the sides of rice and beans were excellent .,2
i split it with my friend and she told me to finish it .,2
upon staying i realized more and more things wrong .,2
and they 're great about accommodating large groups .,2
this is not it .,2
they decided to charge me extra _num_ for gel polish .,2
customer service was quick and accurate !,2
the sangria is phenomenal and strong .,2
i 've loved hello kitty as long as i can remember .,2
tacos and enchiladas are great dinner choices .,2
we enjoyed ourselves immensely - the service was good too .,2
so i said no thanks .,2
you can taste the freshness and that 's exactly what i like .,2
one of the most pleasant experiences i 've had in a gun shop yet !,2
a great place to dine besides the strip !,2
he did n't check up on us to see how we were doing .,2
my last visit was exceptional .,2
our server was helpful and playful .,2
staff always friendly and even accommodate early check in for me .,2
way more fun than we even imagined .,2
"overall , a terrible experience on day _num_ .",2
the one major perk of the excalibur is the location .,2
"- shower only , no bathtub .",2
this place is a classic !,2
our entrees were also quite good .,2
i have never seen worse customer service .,2
"overall , beautiful restaurant for a calm weekend lunch .",2
sad that they keep change server and change chef .,2
"inventive , unique and wonderful .",2
worse than any hotel or motel i have ever been to !,2
one of my favorite places to eat .,2
i could 've left to get food and been back in that time !,2
but rest of my family did really enjoyed their food .,2
the food was very good .,2
we also shared the huge serving of paella .,2
"i just switched the bags , i had n't opened it . ''",2
after reading yelp reviews i was hesitant and for good reason .,2
this place is run terribly avoid at all costs !,2
"great ambiance , fabulous food , and their drinks are to die for .",2
waiters were very attentive to our large group and the food was very tasty .,2
i look forward to it !,2
i could do it and i 'm not even a professional .,2
consistently exceptional and worth a visit .,2
the staff is very friendly .,2
has no one heard of customer service ?,2
they do n't tell you that when you book the hotel .,2
would n't call another employee to help .,2
so sad as i love love me some fried okra .,2
very poor customer service at front counters and cleanliness .,2
the food here is very satisfying and the service is great as well .,2
the only decent thing was the sweet green tea .,2
fast easy and stress free way to travel the strip .,2
"however , he knew what was going on and apologized for it .",2
shame on excalibur hotel/casino .,2
"after some time , i decided to give this place another chance .",2
when my family and i was signing the lease i was very nervous !,2
stuffed dates awesome ... .,2
it is worth the wait in my opinion .,2
atmosphere is relaxing and entertaining .,2
"luis was the perfect waiter , attentive and knowledgeable .",2
great atmosphere and food awsome selection of cocktails .,2
there was lots of energy and very pleasant atmosphere .,2
"the dj there played great island music , as well .",2
this hotel is very outdated .,2
"a year ago , i probably would have given harrah 's three stars .",2
"thanks , but no thanks .",2
the go into _num_ room & it was dirty .,2
"i mean seriously , this is a convention center .",2
we enjoyed another stellar meal at circo .,2

"it 's cheap and all , but damn so far away from things !",2
they did a good job with the decorating .,2

the place inside is disgusting .,2
the cookies were ridiculously fresh and still warm from the oven .,2
"sleep in bed , and stole the purse that was on the table .",2
ca n't smoke in the restaurant side .,2
the pool hours really need to be extended .,2
"so again , i asked him to quote me the price .",2
"( spa , gym , pool , wi-fi , etc ) .",2
it reminded me of a greyhound bus terminal .,2
"and of course , their sangria goes with all of their dishes !",2
"_num_ star : cheap cost of hotels , good location to venetian and bellagio .",2
the heels are the best .,2
"however , when i review i feel like _num_ stars is the best ever .",2

their red sangria is so good !,2
"our instructor , rob was great , fun and cool .",2

"_num_ nights $ _num_ , not well spent .",2
thanks for ruining my first trip u o vegas .,2
but it was not on sale .,2
"pricey , but worth it .",2
everything i had was ridiculously good .,2
nothing like taking the long way around when it 's _num_ outside .,2

long long check in lines .,2
there is no wifi !,2
mostly every visitor pays a visit for this walgreens .,2

"one for men , one for women !",2
$ _num_ for this !,2
the food is extremely over priced and it was not just bad but horrible .,2
"romantic view , very nice & courteous server , & tasty food !",2
they had a variety and not all of them would break the bank .,2
but the main point is the food - and circo delivers .,2
"i left , never to return .",2
- no free wifi !,2
- plumbing is loud and there was no hot water on sunday morning .,2
service is warm and professional and the wine list very comprehensive .,2
the place needs fixing in the visual sense and more structure in their organization .,2
the tv remote was missing but did n't call for that .,2
at that point he was just annoyed and said give us the bill .,2
"it tasted phenomenal , and i could barely taste the liquor .",2
for $ _num_ a person for dinner so not worth it .,2
the room was large enough to accomodate the roll away without feeling cramped .,2
nice peeps and handy from the venetian .,2

i think i will stay elsewhere next time i am there .,2
my son in laws steak was overcooked and my daughters steak had no flavor .,2
great tapas and sangria !,2
came here for lunch and had an excellent sandwich .,2
pitchers of sangria always make the mood more festive .,2
not a very good place to find a nice restaurant or for shopping .,2
"fresh flour tortillas , pork empanadas , with a fantastic red sauce .",2
"hot room , not cleaned properly and just plain beat up .",2
i wish it had he option to put zero stars !,2

we were lucky enough to get a complimentary room upgrade which was nice .,2
we will not be staying here again .,2
i really love the food here .,2
anyhow i just wanted to express my extreme disappointment in this particular location .,2
because i certainly left with a bitter taste in my mouth .,2
rude bell hop that had a major attitude and was short with us .,2
this is one of my favorite places to gamble in vegas .,2
small plates make it fun to try a little of everything .,2
but the price is what draws everyone to this place .,2
"i the appetizers are delicious as well , for a good price .",2
the food is very solid .,2
great place to stop for gelato while walking through the venetian .,2
the business is full of everything you can imagine and a lot more .,2

my wife ordered her wings naked with no sauce .,2
"cheap , old , dirty .",2

no friendly staff and shitty management !,2
"the service is wonderful and very attentive , definetly _num_ star service !",2
"an amazing old fashioned , fantastic dinner , great view , excellent service .",2
then our waitress was friendly enough but not a good waitress .,2
i hear the food is amazing too .,2
there 's just one thing going for excalibur - it 's cheap .,2
we stayed here for four nights in a two bedroom suite .,2
"if you have used these products , you know the impeccable quality .",2
she also gave no direction on how to get to the room .,2
"but all smokey , older casino 's are all the same .",2
this is a great place to just grab a quick bite !,2

housekeeping folks ( most ) walk right by you without even a glance .,2
this place is horrible it looks nice but so not worth it .,2

best carbonara i 've ever had !,2
"authentic , delicious , and above all affordable tapas off-strip in las vegas .",2

he was very informative and outgoing .,2
this was an amazing experience !,2
the food was also delicious .,2
"ok if i could give this place _num_ stars , i would .",2

we just did this for our anniversary and our was the perfect date .,2
the rooms smelt like smoke even though it was a non-smoking room .,2
i ate one of them and refused to try another they were so bad .,2
they were nice and efficient and the bagels were nice and chewy .,2
that moment was _num_ minutes later .,2
i never use any of the so called amenities that this resort fee covers .,2
nothing like that ever happened .,2
worth the trip off the strip .,2
"after it was sent back , it came back still kicking around .",2
the price is right and the location is great !,2
"it 's dark , you ca n't see anything .",2

there are twists and turns and wide hallways to accommodate the vegas sized crowds .,2
when we get up there was n't as clean as it should of been .,2

my favorite store at the premium outlet mall .,2

sat down with my boyfriend and a friend at the electronic roulette table .,2

"found the food to be quite good , the service fast and accommodating .",2
"once again , it was huge & really good ; highly recommend !",2
"unfortunately , our stay did not end on a pleasant note .",2
"the breakfast has waffles , eggs , potatoes , juices , yogurt , etc .",2
"service was excellent , and great people watching !",2
soooo not coming back !,2
"the bed was ok for me , but uncomfortable for my wife .",2
good place to spend some extra cash .,2
"but it 's a sad , tired , shit hole nevertheless .",2
"wo n't be going back , which is a shame .",2
everything is really nice and updated and picture perfect albeit a little small .,2
great place in vegas to grab a quick tan !,2
god only knows what kind of fluids left those stains !,2
this one was a pleasant surprise .,2
what a great place !,2
i would highly recommend staying here !,2
"then , they hire a bunch of security guards to guide traffic .",2
and the selection of gear and shoes is good .,2
"my whole family rocks nike , and nike town is where we go .",2
it was so dry and did not have any flavor at all .,2
"the dealers we had were just awful , we were at the blackjack table .",2
i 'm from chicago and we use real cheese !,2
this place used to be one of my favorite malls .,2
it 's a very popular spot for the locals .,2
"paying guests should have a place to park , no matter what .",2
but it was still a little uncomfortable and we felt rushed .,2
i really enjoy this place .,2
wonderful service and a fun experience .,2
i enjoy people who take their job seriously .,2
its a fun spot !,2
do n't stay here .,2
today i was disappointed to the server .,2
the folks here were really nice and knowledgeable .,2
horrible is an understatement !,2
"last , and certainly not least , they lack wifi .",2
my pastrami rueben was fantastic .,2
", the tuna tartare was amazing !",2
the driver was very friendly and able to discuss guns at length .,2
security never smiles and it seems like everyone is drunk .,2
we get on the shuttle only to find it charges _num_ a head .,2
sorry guys but after this our accounts will be canceled .,2
i understand that it was cheap and old but it was absolutely disgusting .,2
retro menu and prices to match .,2
one of my favorites in vegas .,2
it took over _num_ hours to fix my car .,2
probably the most fun thing i 've done since moving here .,2
room _num_ : rude front desk managers .,2
i 'm not gon na even waste my time with them anymore .,2
hotel gets very crowded and there is not much walking space .,2
much better than the other places i hit up for lunch .,2
this place is a landmark of vegas but it needs some major improvements .,2
there was no bed bugs and the bathroom was big .,2
"the room was well stocked , clean , and came with complementary wifi .",2
the carpets are dirty and grimy and the `` stores '' are lacking .,2
great photos and all around phenomenal place !,2
thankfully it 's only noon and i got my hubby by my side !,2
will definitely be going back .,2
a memorable experience that will surely last a lifetime .,2
the rooms are small and the walls are sooooooo thin .,2
i highly recommend the beef rib .,2
they did n't want to serve us and made it very clear .,2
"i was n't expecting much from ratings , but i was quite surprised .",2
i will update this review if i ever get an appointment .,2
the price the quality of the food and everything else is just terrific .,2
my food was good and the service was very good .,2
i recommend it for sure !,2
your housekeeping staff simply forgot us .,2
we will definitely be coming back !,2
but i still come here pretty often .,2
i 'm so glad i found this starbucks .,2
friendly staff and quick turnover at the lines .,2
wo n't be going back anytime soon .,2
"i stopped in with some friends , and we are an odd group .",2
the location is perfect !,2
however nobody informed my parents .,2
he was very rude and even said `` welcome to big business ! '',2
they 're much nicer over there plus they care about how their store looks .,2
the bacon wrapped dates are awesome !,2
the ladies there a spectacular !,2
"great place- food was excellent , for the most part .",2
worst buffet i 've ever eaten at .,2
nobody is responsible and you just leave guests hanging ?,2
booked this hotel for a business event -- meeting room and several guest rooms .,2
we got no help and no assistance from management .,2
first off : i hate car buying .,2
it was like a canned tomato with some sweetness .,2
will definitely be going there again !,2
"the bathroom could sure use a makeover , but was clean enough .",2
ok excalibur is n't a great hotel .,2
the shrimp were also extremely small and appeared to be slimy and undercooked .,2
"sangria ( we had the red ) was good , but not outstanding .",2
"did n't get that , got ground beef instead .",2
spago is one of the best reasonably priced restaurants in las vegas .,2
thanks but free drinks are already provided when i gamble .,2
the hotel as a whole is dated .,2
i liked the very contemporary decor .,2
"two visits ago , just after new year 's i was disappointed .",2
something you `` have '' to get when your in vegas !,2
one being that the toilet was making a lot of noise .,2
charging _num_ is bullshit too .,2
the food was quick and fantastic !,2
they are so friendly and really care .,2
they were both great .,2
drinks and service always deliver !,2
if we could 've gotten a room elsewhere we would have .,2
they 're so ridiculously good .,2
big fan of this place !,2
sounds like this place gets pretty packed .,2
"not only that , they have horrible customer service !",2
this place does not deserve any stars .,2
everything on the menu is delicious !,2
"come one , this is _num_ !",2
he is the best !,2
i feel i have to say about my terrible experience in alize .,2
it hit the spot that was for sure .,2
"either way , i enjoyed this venue because of our amazing waiter .",2
of course their pizzas are great as well !,2
but the employees were so unprofessional and unsafe .,2
the bacon does n't have any taste .,2
the next strike was the deal breaker .,2
no security camera on the hallways .,2
no security camera on the hallways .,2
they will not honor warranty .,2
best meal i 've had so far on this trip !,2
it was kind of gross .,2
i do not know what is wrong with them .,2
very enjoyable and the service was excellent .,2
"i was there for a convention , not gambling .",2
service was excellent too .,2
i requested _num_ attached rooms for my party .,2
i 've had a better sleep in holiday inn .,2
not too bad but what i did see dirty was gross .,2
lettuce wraps are great .,2
"this one , however , not so much .",2
i will definitely be back .,2
i will definitely be back .,2
i will definitely be back .,2
our particular room was very dark even with all the lights turned on .,2
"the dessert was good , but not amazing .",2
i ordered the beef carpaccio and chicken with the sauce on the side .,2
delicious chopped salad and margherita pizza .,2
"rude , disrespectful , and way too much attitude .",2
it was awful for a supposed upscale joint .,2
this place off the strip really nails it !,2
they made my vision come completely true !,2
this is my favorite restaurant in vegas .,2
extremely rude and very unhelpful .,2
i 've had cheesesteaks in philly several times and this does not compare .,2
the only area that has wifi is the conference rooms .,2
worst experience in vegas ever .,2
now back to the dirty dining situation this place could use some love .,2
i did n't sit in it or set my luggage on it .,2
the food was excellent and the portions were quite big .,2
_num_ $ in savings but nothing 's worth getting .,2
"based on that along , i will never stay here again .",2
food was delicious and ambiance sophisticated .,2
i let it go thinking the smell would go away after a while .,2
"harrah 's said , `` no prob . ''",2
i even feel comfortable using it alone .,2
"me , i think harrah 's sucks .",2
i came here with my date and spago lived up to expectations .,2
would recommend this to families with young children .,2
always excellent service and good food at a reasonable price .,2
it smells delicious ! '',2
i did n't finish my food .,2
a very good hotel with clean rooms above _num_ star i should rate .,2
"so many yummy flavors , good god !",2
they also serve nice yummy mojitos by the pitcher .,2
good coffee and my breakfast burrito was great .,2
lets start with the sangria .,2
do not go here thinking you 're getting a great dinner .,2
definitely coming back next time we 're in town !,2
the food was all very fresh and tasted great .,2
it was just horrible .,2
the shower head sprayed all over the ceiling and walls .,2
i was there with another male friend and we are not sharing a bed .,2
definitely one of the highlights of my trip to vegas .,2
"also , the outdoor venue is so fun .",2
you ca n't find a cheaper place around to practice at .,2
"laughing , the server pointed to the empty lobster tank .",2
i will return next time in vegas .,2
if you love sushi then you know it is not cheap .,2
what a great find on our recent trip to vegas .,2
everything that we ate was absolutely delicious and seasoned well !,2
people this is _num_ what are you thinking off ?,2
"one of my top ten restaurants of all , hands-down .",2
our waiter jerry was awesome !,2
i just love this place for lunch !,2
i was not a fan of the dingy vibe just walking in here .,2
overall : the rooms were fine but the customer service was appalling .,2
and as for the arcade a lot of the games were not working .,2
great food great drinks and good service .,2
they use a mechanical car washer and dry your car by hand .,2
it is the best thing i have ever drank .,2
please do n't make the same mistake i did and waste your time here .,2
no excuse for this .,2
bring your own ammo .,2
these employees are complete morons .,2
"as soon as the elevators opened , the smell was overwhelming .",2
"wow , i really needed this meal .",2
the salmon was amazing .,2
toilet did n't flush properly .,2
when we addressed it they said it was okay and proceeded on talking shit .,2
the absolute and worst customer service i have ever received in my entire life .,2
some negatives ... you can call ahead to request your car from valet .,2
paris and all the other related hotels was booked .,2
i stayed here and hated it .,2
i have more to say but i just do n't feel like it .,2
pizza was wood fire and amazing .,2
a delight to work with .,2
very rundown hotel room .,2
maybe the cook had a bad night .,2
i was very disappointed with this property .,2
cooked to a perfect med rare .,2
its also a fun place to gamble slots seem pretty loose .,2
then after i fed my kids the crap they gave me .,2
these cheesesteaks are no longer the ( pop ) pride of philly .,2
finally found one here .,2
i just used my iphone !,2
also there drinks are so good and happy hour is from 9pm to close !,2
just got home from vacation .,2
"i did n't expect the ritz , but this place is just plain nasty .",2
the bathroom was extremely spacious and we were given plenty of towels .,2
the room felt like a motel rather than a hotel .,2
not until our recent trip to vegas that we will never go back again .,2
the smooth & creamy gelato is an absolute delight !,2
what happens in vegas does not stay there .,2
i dont want to give them even one star .,2
"plain and simple , the lobby in here has seen better days !",2
the food was spectacular and the service was above average .,2
the sushi rice was too sweet .,2
the quality of furniture is very low end .,2
the veal was overcooked and drowned in sauce .,2
it was delicious and had huge chunks of fresh salmon in the spread .,2
it was n't the best looking hotel .,2
tips : perfect spot for groups ( there 's something for everyone ) .,2
this is a great store to look for clothing for any occasion .,2
i highly recommend it !,2
i highly recommend it !,2
this place is definitely one of the best local favorites in vegas .,2
"some traditional tapas , some relatively unique .",2
"i asked for the name , and i could not have it .",2
bacon almond dates are amazing .,2
we walked in and everything we knew was gone .,2
the smell of the lobby is pretty bad .,2
worst hotel experience of my life !,2
never seen such a horribly designed parking structure at a convention center .,2
she had fun and enjoyed the food .,2
this place just really needs an overhaul to bring it up to speed .,2
"however , service is lacking .",2
"as much as i come to this denny 's , i hate this location .",2
"it 's definitely cheap to stay here , but why would you want to ?",2
but ... and it 's a big one - the room sucked .,2
he comes back sometime later with the same dish with the same chicken cooked .,2
places like this should not be running .,2
"when i first walked in , everyone was friendly enough .",2
thank you for great service !,2
"my seabass was moist and buttery , just how i like it .",2
the ice cream is pretty pricy as well .,2
the food was pretty good and the dishes were very unique .,2
she is talented beyond belief .,2
it was good and fresh .,2
definitely some good peruvian food .,2
placed a order for wings french fries and fried green beans .,2
oh and they have a great selection of drinks as well .,2
what a super afternoon all of us had .,2
who the hell voted for this place ?,2
they must have pretty low standards !,2
maybe there 's a food shortage in vegas .,2
"i am seriously so grossed out , i ca n't even fall asleep .",2
the location is fantastic for visiting the strip .,2
my idea of the perfect address .,2
the hallways seem to be a little newer than the rooms .,2
: ) it made for a really great food memory .,2
"instead of helping the situation , she wanted to get rid of me quickly .",2
"sorry larry , your employee just pissed off a valuable customer .",2
i 'm not a fan of this casino or their rooms .,2
it flat out sucks here .,2
"also some very awesome shoes , coach is definitely on the up and up !",2
everything here is so delicious !,2
great prices compared to some of the places in hotel pool areas .,2
i do n't care about the fee i care because he lied to us .,2
"fabulous italian food , and wonderful old vegas ambience .",2
good mix of flavors but i would avoid the calamari .,2
vacation time is precious and excalibur does not get out !,2
"but no , more lies and excuses .",2
definitely worth a stop next time in vegas !,2
the food here is excellent .,2
unfriendly clerk at counters .,2
"no i didnt mean no wifi , i mean no internet !",2
you guys are awesome !,2
"however , i do believe i 've tasted much better tapas before .",2
this place is still really okay .,2
the swimming pool was down right scary .,2
pillows were comfortable and the covers were nice and warm .,2
i 'm gon na say that i 'll probably not stay here again .,2
"room was $ _num_ weeknight , $ _num_ weekend .",2
they should have paid me to stay here .,2
i dare you name a place in vegas that comes anywhere close .,2
he 's the sexy bartender there .,2
do not go to pop 's cheese steak resturant .,2
prices were fair ( most games $ _num_ ) .,2
which any other bank takes to cash one of there own checks .,2
"our server josh was superb , full of fun and knowledge about the menu .",2
and their lox cream cheese spread is awesome !,2
mark our waiter was the worst i have ever had in vegas .,2
"ask for oscar , he is so sweet and knowledgeable !",2
"ordered a large pep pizza , chicken tenders , and chilli fries .",2
food was bland and service was not the greatest .,2
there were no cabs outside .,2
this is the worst place i have ever had my hair done !,2
$ _num_ a pound .,2
i will probably stay here again if the price is right next time .,2
i also had their veal parmesan which was rich and super tasty !,2
a full dollar more than the already overpriced menu ?,2
"almost $ _num_ for eggs , bland potatoes and sausage links .",2
too bad you ca n't get drunk off their stingy well drinks .,2
"night time , it looks better , but then everything looks better at night .",2
but no those prices do n't matter !,2
great ambiance and drinks .,2
anyways thank you all and keep up the good work .,2
"at best , everyone 's dish was mediocre .",2
great service and such a good deal for happy hour !,2
the fish was greasy and breading had no seasoning .,2
so why the _num_ ?,2
i will definitely be visiting this shop again !,2
one of the all time worst meals i 've ever had .,2
"anyway , fish was ok.",2
the roasted mussels were very good indeed .,2
"this is a great , relaxing restaurant -- you must eat there !",2
he said he just needed to use drain cleaner and everything was fine .,2
did i mention the service was atrocious ?,2
they sincerely apologized and refunded us about the situation we had to go through .,2
the stay itself was alright .,2
i way it could be cleaned .,2
just thought i would give a good review where it deserved .,2
"just okay : room , service , pool , prices .",2
great service and on-time .,2
"as a regular customer at discount firearms , i would highly recommend this store .",2
its a lot of fun not only for kids but adults as well .,2
the food was delicious and served in very generous amounts .,2
must have been a bad day ?,2
the only thing this place has going for it is the view .,2
friendly service but the wait for the food is out of this world .,2
"unfortunately there is little choice in the desert , which i also hate .",2
very romantic and elegant .,2
we went here for the 2nd time last night and everything was great !,2
it became unbearable to simply walk in and out of the hotel !,2
not a normal amount like you would in a normal soy sauce dipping tray .,2
complete waste of my money .,2
"the new bathrooms were bigger and clean , food was excellent .",2
excellent margaritas and awesome sangria .,2
then they asked me to pull into the first bay again .,2
too bad that this place was n't that great .,2
if i could rate this place _num_ stars i would !,2
they also charge over $ _num_ per day for a resort fee .,2
"if you want excitement , take $ _num_ and go to las vegas .",2
"nice location , conveniently on the strip .",2
do n't stay here !,2
terrific sangria and a massive selection of tapas that includes some real winners .,2
i had the short rib and it was very good .,2
"according to one member of our party , the mojito was amazing .",2
"salads , pizza and pasta are all good .",2
great service and fast cooks !,2
both were fresh and tasty .,2
highly recommend for families .,2
do n't come here if you want to stay because of the service .,2
this place only has one pool but it was a good one .,2
staff was great as well .,2
the next night we ordered sweet and sour chicken and it was soooo good !,2
do n't waste your money !,2
loved the test tube !,2
but still ... there are way better malls here in vegas .,2
what kind of hotel does not have wifi ?,2
it 's short and sweet !,2
they did n't try n even help .,2
my favorite restaurant of all time .,2
has a great time !,2
more proof that you can wrap most anything in bacon !,2
i told them several times that the problem is something other than the bulb .,2
we wo n't be returning .,2
we wo n't be returning .,2
"this place has won awards , had to try it .",2
we also eat here on our way out of vegas .,2
"awesome food , that 's all i have to say .",2
"though check in is a mile long , the casino floor is surprisingly empty .",2
the staff here knows their stuff and are very professional .,2
best bagels in town .,2
the staff is friendly and truly dedicated to their customers .,2
keep in mind we had a car .,2
the lady i had was not very professional at all .,2
the restaurants that i recommend are vince neal 's and the buffet .,2
thrown in the towel ?,2
"anyway , the rooms are the pretty standard low budget hotel rooms in vegas .",2
horrible turnover from one server to the next .,2
"wine list is grand , and the service was outstanding !",2
car was n't that clean .,2
the ambiance and vibe just add to everything .,2
not particularly flavorful or delicious .,2
the labor per hour rate was $ _num_ !,2
the service are great as well .,2
zero stars would be too generous for this crap hole .,2
make sure you triple check your home before you purchase your home through them .,2
"always fresh , always delicious !",2
very disappointed very annoyed very frustrated .,2
it was paper thin and did n't offer any warmth or comfort .,2
you ca n't just blame excalibur .,2
our room was looking at a wall and trash exit of some restaurant .,2
"times have changed , but excalibur remains stuck in the middle ages .",2
would never ever return to stay .,2
it was our anniversary & we went here with a big group of friends .,2
best bagels and breakfast in town .,2
we ordered a `` popcorn lobster '' roll ...,2
"this meal , was just amazing .",2
a short distance off the strip but well worth it .,2
this hotel smells ... ew i would never stay here .,2
the best thing about this hotel is the location .,2
i absolutely loved madame tussauds !,2
thanks also for the smooth move in .,2
paying hotel rates for a pull out couch was like visiting the parents .,2
house keeping did not come once in _num_ days .,2
torn wallpaper and mold are your most common decor .,2
the food is delicious .,2
the food is delicious .,2
the food is delicious .,2
the food is delicious .,2
stayed here during my first time in vegas .,2
"i know , in vegas , people smoke .",2
"i know , in vegas , people smoke .",2
just another way for the hotels to take your dollars away .,2
room was clean and perfect .,2
fun and excitement - this is a one stop shop hotel .,2
ca n't take food to go unless you sit down .,2
it was a truly strange and awful experience .,2
"barely opened , but most rooms are completely sealed .",2
and the smell of smoke is all over the casino floor .,2
my family will come back again and will recommend it to everyone .,2
portions and quality went down quite a bit .,2
"business dinner , staff was very professional , good selection of wine .",2
that is the only reason this place gets _num_ stars .,2
"great menu , fast service , nice atmosphere , reasonable prices .",2
anyways back to the crappy hotel that is the excalibur .,2
"it did not come with a microwave , fridge , or a view .",2
the location is perfect .,2
the location is perfect .,2
not at any price not free not for a fee .,2
and i would n't recommend this place at all .,2
it has a local feel that was a treasure in sin city .,2
the location is perfect right in the middle of the lv strip .,2
do not get the buffet .,2
ambiance was warm and intimate .,2
the gravy was all but tasteless white goo .,2
the shrimp and lobster linguine pasta is good and they give you a lot !,2
all of the poor reviews are right .,2
"back in town , and made this my dinner stop .",2
some real traditional mexican cooking with good quality fresh ingredients .,2
"ok , really , there are n't many problems to complain about .",2
"it has nice atmosphere , good mexican food , and good service .",2
polo towers never again !,2
i was pretty disappointed with their front desk customer service .,2
such a great restaurant !,2
seriously the worst place ever .,2
we can only assume it was food poisoning .,2
open pretty late as well .,2
came here for a friend 's bday celebration this weekend .,2
the ultimate pina colada is refreshing .,2
a little disappointing for a hotel on the strip .,2
"just as they were at every other location , they are unmatched and delicious !",2
but then i also noticed that they opened my car hood ?,2
this place was very good .,2
"but stay , because the tapas are so good .",2
no meat and disappointing .,2
their front office staff is apparently really bad and has no customer focus .,2
the room itself was pretty good .,2
next time i will have to make sure to get here for happy hour .,2
las vegas style mexican cuisine at its best .,2
not only was my blow dry something out of the 80s .,2
the service was very rude and unfriendly .,2
best macy 's in las vegas !,2
the food was so incredibly delicious .,2
service was great also .,2
i got my make up done at the mac counter .,2
we all ended up happy and stuffed .,2
trash on the floor and someone had obviously been laying on the bed .,2
i eventually canceled my order because everybody was almost done with their food already .,2
we got a cheap rate and along with that you get an average room .,2
not a fan of the philly cheese steak here .,2
"i was told someone would contact me within _num_ days , never happened .",2
drinks were good and food was perfect !,2
i had tuna tartar and it was the best i 've ever had .,2
the monorail is good for when going to trade shows at the convention center .,2
the food itself was pretty tasty .,2
this place has really good food period .,2
next time i come to vegas i 'll add that extra shot lol .,2
great tasting and loaded drinks too .,2
from the bar to our table everything was perfect !,2
what wonderful bagels they make !,2
parking is at least easy and admission is free .,2
so i am like the old grandma playing slot machines .,2
go elsewhere cause this is not worth it .,2
i wish i had read the other reviews before booking .,2
"yikes , can anyone really eat $ _num_ worth of crappy food .",2
the food was fantastic !,2
the food was fantastic !,2
it was soooo good !,2
the food is great and the prices ca n't be beat .,2
great service and they are open late !,2
they are dishonest and the ownership is extremely rude .,2
just jump right on in .,2
i 've already given this place a second chance .,2
best spot before hitting up the clubs .,2
no one has returned our multiple calls and emails .,2
"their paella was fresh , authentically seasoned and reasonably priced .",2
sparse would be one word that comes to mind .,2
the filet mignon sliders were delicious !,2
it just seemed old and stale and dirty .,2
came back for apps and drinks for happy hour hopping ... .,2
we also tried a sushi roll as well and it was also very good .,2
"for drinks , we ordered the jalapeo margarita and it was really good .",2
i would not stay here again even if they paid me .,2
if you are a sushi snob then this is not your place .,2
"off the beaten path , the service was excellent and the food was excellent .",2
the place is just straight up trashy .,2
"i love the atmosphere , music , it 's so much fun .",2
"anyway , the bell people were super rude .",2
this place is amazing and bar service is exceptional !,2
i could n't wear them anymore and took it back .,2
i loved the monorail .,2
would recommend this place !,2
"well , after the terrible service the beer just did n't taste very good .",2
too many places in here closed down in recent years .,2
"being in so cali my whole life , we are mall snobs .",2
helpful staff ; the buffet is great for the price .,2
"should have just driven away , worst , liquid , overpriced shake ever .",2
"so many choices , great store !",2
the food is awesome too .,2
look - david and his staff are the best .,2
i ca n't even right a review except for the worst service ever .,2
"choice of red , white , or sparkling .",2
that information was obviously wrong .,2
alot of cool memorabilia throughout the place too .,2
the bar is impressive ask bruce to mix you a drink !,2
the service was beyond poor and the stromboli was a total disappointment .,2
i probably wouldnt check this place out again .,2
"my advice for an old , rundown property like this ?",2
the lack of cleanliness is very evident in this hotel .,2
_num_ min later still no server .,2
"$ _num_ later , i was bummed .",2
there house made dressing is wonderful .,2
best of the best in las vegas so far .,2
great for kids of all ages .,2
"oh well , at least this place provided me with another place to yelp !",2
"wait staff ( james ) was professional , attentive , engaging and fun !",2
wall paper was peeling and table had sticky stuff on it .,2
"the place is beautiful and bright , and has a perfect ambiance .",2
i was disgusted to get into the shower even .,2
she said we would have to find out on our own .,2
"otherwise , a decent night can become an embarrassing nightmare .",2
excellent tapas restaurant with a spectacular view and reasonable prices !,2
the worst hotel experience ever !,2
it then took another _num_ or _num_ minutes before we got our drinks .,2
omg this place is awesome .,2
guess this guy missed vegas _num_ .,2
"watch out , it 's addictive .",2
i asked guest services to come up _num_ different nights and nobody ever came .,2
the spa was the worst experience i have ever had in a spa .,2
it 's located in a strip mall and parking can be tight .,2
for me it was the first cocktail of my day and made to perfection .,2
it 's so frustrating !,2
i got a very very very good wig and very much worth the money .,2
excellent customer service ... and the jerk shrimp is the best ever ... .,2
it was a nice relaxing comforting lunch to end our fun trip in vegas .,2
no one came to the table to check on us and follow-up .,2
the service however was very poor .,2
dont know why we keep coming back .,2
the chips and salsa to start were fresh and really good .,2
the towels are cheap and stiff .,2
what kinda cheap spit is that ?,2
looks like it has n't been upgraded in _num_ years .,2
brought back to office and had rave reviews .,2
everything from the music to the food to the table candles was wonderful !,2
"if you have , i think you can pass on this one .",2
this is the worst for a disabled person to have to go through .,2
the mushroom ravioli is full of flavor .,2
it was delicious and the drinks were amazing .,2
its quite a shame .,2
one word : gross .,2
what a disappointment for our girls ' getaway weekend !,2
the cilantro rice has a really great fresh taste to it .,2
the whole experience takes approximately one hour and is definitely worth it !,2
"show just ok , long line to get drinks .",2
"harrah 's is old vegas , meaning smokey and nasty .",2
"the mojitos pitchers are good , not the best but good .",2
"still , the tapas and sangria are great .",2
the food and sparkling sangria are amazing !,2
"go for drinks , for outdoor sitting , for good talks and good food .",2
i 'm one happy camper !,2
the sangria was okay and the infused vodka was actually really good .,2
we ate at many places and by far spago had the best service !,2
"the more i hit this spot , the more this place hits the spot .",2
the dinner roll was a french bread loaf cut in half .,2
the service is good and the servers are always friendly .,2
the service is great and the drinks are never more than $ _num_ .,2
spring rolls are amazing !,2
but i 'm also not thrilled with the excalibur .,2
"this place is very quiet , mellow , and intimate .",2
"good food , good drink , good company = good time .",2
old school italian vegas at its finest !,2
she really was exceptional !,2
you might wait a while to get in but it 's worth it .,2
wow what a great place to eat in vegas !,2
so suggesting you do a togo order instead of sitting .,2
also extremely ghetto looking employees .,2
he doesnt offer to give me another one and was very rude .,2
my recommendation is that nobody else bother him either .,2
thoroughly enjoyed my don julio _num_ with their excellent chips and salsa .,2
it was perfect and i 'm quite picky about steak .,2
our room was not that great .,2
"it was hard , dried out , and had no flavor .",2
the shower had very low water pressure and there was no tub .,2
what kind of a vegas hotel does n't have wifi in _num_ !,2
"katie , the instructor , was incredible .",2
the crazy thing is that it is reasonably priced as well !,2
the shower ( no tub ) was dingy .,2
probably so good its comparable to homemade filipino food from my in laws .,2
a dollar less maybe _num_ cents ?,2
such an amazing job .,2
my wife and i sat down and we ordered .,2
no other major casino on the strip left such a negative impression as excalibur .,2
oh yeah ... dick 's last resort ?,2

shame on the city .,2
they were huge and so tasty !,2
i highly recommend going to the perfect princess cut .,2
"the room smelt funny , like moldy .",2
the casino is not great .,2
"plenty of apologies , but none were apologies for using pathetic unsafe practices .",2
"the room was decent , but unclean .",2
the steak was burnt and the mushrooms for the side tasted canned .,2
we have tried almost everything on the cafe menu and love it !,2
totally worth every penny .,2
i could 've paid a little more and stayed at a nicer place .,2
the worst customer service i have ever received at a bank .,2
best bagels in vegas .,2
leave our luggage with her and come back at _num_ am to check in .,2
the sweet chipotle bbq sauce perfectly complimented the barbacoa .,2
this place was not closed for `` renovations '' .,2
"they 're known for their osso buco , which is delicious .",2
there 's so many things wrong with this place .,2
the only positive thing about hotel was the food choices .,2
rude or boring dealers and house keeping rushed us out .,2
this place is an awesome dive .,2
i had dinner there last night and it was amazing .,2
i recommend you try their paella !,2
best deal on drinks in vegas !,2
"sorry , but the cheddar biscuits are n't enough to bring me back .",2
the only thing it has going for it is location .,2
"it was a mess , i was very disappointed .",2
it was so fatty and disgusting looking .,2
now i ca n't wait to leave and find another hotel .,2
great quality for the price .,2
"not acceptable , i am very , very , very disappointed .",2
the beds were hard as a rock and the blankets were thin and cheap .,2
i stayed here for an entire week for business in july _num_ .,2
not sure i care to give this place another try in the near future .,2
early morning visit approx 3am .,2
"fantastic restaurant ; great service , great food .",2

the toilet wouldnt flush .,2
there are two floors filled with an array of wonderful nike products .,2
tacos were seasoned well and tres leches ... cake was heavenly .,2
she does not address any of your concerns .,2

it 's convenient and easy to get to different part of the strip .,2

"not classy , even if you are a cheaper hotel .",2
the shelves are usually empty .,2
"from my experience , breakfast seems to be the best meal in the buffets .",2
all the food was great and so was the sangria .,2
firefly did an outstanding job of serving up both items .,2
firefly did not the mark for me or the rest of my table .,2
why do n't you tell me when i called ?,2

celebrated my wife 's bday here .,2
almost everything we had on the menu was sooo good .,2
"but be careful , these drinks are strong !",2
the service from the front desk was above average .,2
"when we return to vegas , i guarantee we will be back !",2
great environment and service was terrific .,2
my view looks like i 'm looking at a prison .,2
i will not purchase a home from this company again ... moving soon .,2
save your money and avoid this scam .,2
portion size is just perfect !,2
they treated me as if i was stupid .,2
they overcharged me _num_ times ridiculous !,2
and of course the bread that comes with it - yummy !,2
"everything i tasted was fresh , excellently presented , and tasty .",2
there was no flair and no charm .,2
the complimentary breads are tasty and beautifully served and the desserts are just okay .,2
this very smoky hotel seems old and outdated .,2
i 'm pretty sure all of the stores have locations elsewhere in vegas anyways .,2
"the best part however , was the cilantro rice .",2
i loved this marriott .,2
room smells great and staff very friendly .,2
"customer beware , this is a horrible outfit .",2
we will definitely be back to explore more of the menu !,2
it 's a great spot for something different than the usual strip spots .,2
seriously ... nothing to expect here .,2
this is my new laundry spot !,2
not fresh and fishy .,2
we both enjoyed the thin crust and liked how it was not really doughy .,2
really nice if you have little ones in tow while in vegas .,2
staying here because my friends are ... no !,2

you will be treated much better a few doors down !,2
the restaurant is loud and small and very high energy .,2
i love the watermelon margarita .,2

"the drinks were strong , the food amazing , the service top notch !",2

it is hit or miss .,2
"cheap , for sure , but you get what you pay for .",2
"it 's an older casino , but they really make it worth your while .",2
"pricey , but good sized portions .",2
therefore i associate junk with the brand .,2
this place is a must when in lv !,2
devine ... and the price is right !,2
so we are upset but obviously need to catch some sleep .,2
do n't like the scam they 're running for the check-in discount .,2
"this place is shabby , thoroughly unimpressed .",2

the venetian and the bellagio are my two favorite spots on the strip .,2

mechanics might need some more training too .,2
just come here to get a great bagel .,2
the best calamari i have ever tasted in my life .,2
i do not recommend this place .,2
honestly i fell in love with our host .,2
over all i probably wo n't choose to stay here on my own .,2
and just be smart about partying if thats what you 're there to do .,2
"the food sucks too , no taste , yuck to bland food !",2
"besides that , however , everything else was mediocre at best .",2
not surprised to read his ratings at all .,2
great location on the strip for the wondering traveler .,2
it 's a much better value than taxis .,2
the servers could n't remember the names of the rolls .,2
those happy hours on the strip ca n't compare to their drinks .,2
each dish was so flavorful and perfect .,2
they add $ _num_ automatically when you use a credit card .,2
we loved everything about firefly .,2
"unfortunately , this stay was simply not up to par .",2
worst service i 've ever had .,2
"well done , everyone !",2
generous portions rule the day here .,2
very disappointed and would never go back .,2
the building is huge inside with a cool water feature as you enter .,2
great for a first date or friends from work !,2
the french toast and pancakes were hard .,2
the pharmacy is the worst i have ever been to .,2
"also , the sparkling sangria is really delicious as well .",2
negative - wifi is awful !,2
i went today for a car wash and they have a new ownership .,2
a big location with plenty of inventory .,2
it was a huge mistake .,2
go back again _num_ days later - 10:30 am - closed again ?,2
gave it two stars instead of one because the waitress was nice .,2
i tried second bed and it was better but not great .,2
the customer service sucked .,2
"gnocchi was outstanding , and the wine pairings were decent .",2
service was awesome and the food was good !,2
it 's operated by an automatic system vs a person which is interesting .,2
the first time i went here i got my oil changed .,2
my colleagues and i eat lunch there once a month .,2
it 's so lovely here !,2
"great atmosphere , nice waitress , good service .",2
"when i sat down , the bartender greeted me and i ordered a water .",2

she was very attentive and gave us our space at the same time .,2
so i paid like $ _num_ more .,2
i 've cooked better stir fry at home .,2
food was simply amazing .,2
"after many years of wondering , wonder no more .",2
i really hate to leave a bad review for this place .,2

this is a hidden gem .,2
we had a few problems with the room though .,2

"if you do plan to stay here , please do n't have high expectations .",2
we also had a terrible view .,2
the smoke became overwhelming ... most casino 's have great ventilation .,2
the circus circus is an underrated hotel and casino .,2
everything was amazing from food to service .,2
like the hotel is trying to make it smell better .,2
great for business meetings or an intimate date .,2
the place is big the service is great .,2
thank you us wigs !,2
i enjoy their drinks and the indoor/outdoor patio area .,2
it 's so hard to make a decision !,2
worst customer service ever !,2
worst customer service ever !,2
worst customer service ever !,2
we even went as late like everybody 's recommended .,2
"cheap , tacky decor seemed to be a big theme at this place .",2
this was not an inexpensive meal either .,2
still no one realized they had double booked the room .,2
the mojitos are deliciously made with fresh fruit .,2
a true vegas experience .,2
some where you would think ok this could happen or whatever .,2
not a good dining experience with every fly in las vegas in your face .,2
and i love hello kitty !,2
our room seems to be clean .,2
he told me he 'd bring me some biscuits and left .,2
i only ate here because my nephew wanted it for his bday .,2
the dealers in the casino were very friendly and helpful .,2
to bad there are n't negative stars !,2

i prefer it over cvs across the street .,2
"great flavors , very creamy and rich .",2
great place to stay if you are on a budget .,2
it was all delicious !,2
the casino has a lot of different games .,2
i reached out to a manager to inform her of the horrible experience .,2
i sat at the bar with bob .,2
the monorail is a great service in vegas .,2
i had the tacos and were pretty good .,2
another extraordinary dining experience @ spago .,2
it was slow but still glad to have internet !,2
when we expressed our concern we never even received a phone call back .,2
interesting and very cheesy since the room was ready anyway .,2
"the bathtub was n't very inviting , even for a shower .",2
highly recommend if you are in the area !,2
caesar salad is excellent !,2
thank you antonio and macy 's !,2
i 've had _num_ appointments at this clinic and i will never go back .,2
i was starving and had to get something else to eat .,2
this is a great place to go off the strip .,2
unless you got nothing to loose with you do n't go here .,2
there was plenty of blue cheese dressing .,2
the manager was wonderful and so accommodating .,2
"bartender is great , and chinese restaurant attached is a trip and really good .",2
very nice place and bartender was a nice fellow .,2
the linens appeared clean and the towels were abundant .,2
we tried a couple of different items that were just disappointing .,2
firefly is one of my favorite restaurants in vegas .,2
the quality and presentation of the food is bad .,2
gave sassy one word answers to questions and refused to be helpful .,2
a+ good customer service .,2
_num_ sliders were seasoned and cooked perfectly .,2
met up with a friend for happy hour .,2
"so maybe the _num_ out of _num_ of us , actually order food .",2
it 's like pouring chocolate over chocolate - it 's a little too much .,2
"my boyfriend , his dad , and i stayed at harrahs .",2
"seriously , security needs to take a giant step back .",2
great christmas decorations ... .,2
thank goodness they have a fashion mall location .,2
she did a wonderful job .,2
no bath tub just shower .,2
"was n't really an upgrade , just a slightly larger room .",2
_num_ minutes later i got my coke .,2
"the atmosphere is awesome , with a young crowd and good vibes all around .",2
my first hand experience is as follows .,2
worst part : i wrote one of the operations managers .,2
their faces changed right away they immediately became short and rude with me .,2
i feel like i do n't have any power to fight back .,2
the artwork on the walls made for some great atmosphere as well !,2
avoid this place at all costs .,2
i always love coming to this place .,2
"and after all , it 's not his fault the kitchen is disgusting .",2
beware - this is n't your typical las vegas hotel .,2
so much flavor packed into each of the items !,2
"not sure , but yuk .",2
they were so nice to us .,2
it left the floor very wet and yucky .,2
this place was the restaurant they used in the movie `` casino '' .,2
cons : poor housekeeping .,2
i 'd definitely return here for a great deal !,2
me and my wife will not be coming to this place again .,2
anyways both dishes highly recommended !,2
my room was the standard king size room and was an okay room .,2
i am struggling to find nice things to say about this place .,2
it was extremely small and parts of it were over cooked .,2
sangria is also quite good .,2
gross would never stay here again and i am pretty easy to please .,2
the service department is the worst i have ever seen .,2
always clean fast and very convenient !,2
i just did n't like the overall ambience .,2
the las vegas monorail was perfect for my recent trip to vegas .,2
this is a terrible place to shop .,2
the lack of wifi in the room was another huge turn off .,2
one of the worst hotels i 've stayed at in vegas .,2
food delicious and service perfect .,2
happy hour is where it 's at too .,2
"so bad , that i had to post this .",2
i wish i could give them no stars honestly .,2
the deli bagels are the best and deli product is great !,2
best item on the menu is the bacon wrapped fig .,2
simply put this place is amazing !,2
great food and service .,2
great food and service .,2
"the chef is really nice , he comes and talks to clients .",2
pretty good for breakfast .,2
she blew me off and told me i will have to wait .,2
stayed there recently with my husband and two daughters .,2
the bread is good as well .,2
an all around amazing experience .,2
and the room did not have a window that opened .,2
the room is very basic .,2
i finally fell back asleep and the trash service outside woke me up again !,2
probably one of the best places i have ever eaten at .,2
it 's been a nightmare to get anything filed .,2
if you want to get around the strip quickly this is the best route .,2
valet was friendly and efficient when checking my luggage for the day after checkout .,2
the service was superb .,2
so i am freaking pissed off .,2
a cool little dive cheap drinks nice atmosphere and good people .,2
"slow to check in , old and parking lot smells .",2
rooms are spacious and comfortable .,2
just a hit or miss place for food and service .,2
"if you lose something at this resort , you will never get it back !",2
the food and the service were excellent !,2
the bathrooms are also only okay .,2
he offered no assistance whatsoever .,2
"i am not about to get into everything , but be warned .",2
would have been better off catching a cheap bite at the palms food court .,2
the outside of a building with four units ?,2
this place has charm .,2
i ended up getting a strawberry mango drink and it was delicious .,2
well it was no where in sight .,2
i like hopping into this location on my way into work !,2
reverse happy hour from _num_ pm to close is the best !,2
this was my go-to place for a long time .,2
"as far as standard bathroom amenities go , this room was totally sub-par .",2
strong and got me buzzed .,2
the waitress was n't super friendly and their food runner was extremely rude .,2
order the tasting menu with wine pairing for an unforgettable meal !,2
go to any grocery chain they all use gloves !,2
we had a wonderful time last night .,2
hell the super _num_ across the way was a better stay than here !,2
"this is so beyond acceptable , i am at a loss .",2
this time around it was awful !,2
make sure to get an extra shot too .,2
they also rushed us when it was our turn .,2
"order their mojitos , they 're so good .",2
"great food and wonderful staff , i 'm so glad i chose this place !",2
a stupid coupon book that did n't have much savings was what we received .,2
had a good time sharing all the tapas with the family .,2
i was very satisfied with my stay here !,2
the room had a old smell to it .,2
but all in all a wonderful dining experience .,2
one pizza is good enough for two .,2
one pizza is good enough for two .,2
"i tried to call , but the phone rang and rang .",2
the most pathetic excuse for a salon .,2
there were peanuts and shells on the floor in the bedroom .,2
"but like the previous posts mentioned , felt like a motel _num_ set up .",2
my car is n't very dirty in the first place .,2
"pretty loud and super casual , lots of great menu options .",2
the lv monorail is awesome !,2
best apple store in vegas to come to .,2
the blow dryer did not work .,2
we were so in love with our wedding floral designs .,2
"reeked of cigarette smoke , looked outdated and the staff looked dated too .",2
i said $ _num_ dollar for my time and gas .,2
it took me and my bf like forever to find it .,2
the lamb sandwich was over the top delicious .,2
hotel manager do n't have any authority to help us .,2
hotel manager do n't have any authority to help us .,2
feel like the chef had no passion on what they are cooking .,2
amazing food and sangria .,2
"i felt gross knowing i stayed in that bed , used that hot tub .",2
the big kicker about this place was the terrible and useless concierge desk .,2
other than that love this place and ca n't wait for my next purchase .,2
the place looks old and tired .,2
it 's a disappointment that the service was subpar .,2
it was tiny and completely lacking any touch .,2
the lamb chops were especially very good !,2
"hell , for the price , excalibur is n't that bad .",2
i would suggest bally 's or planet hollywood for the younger crowd .,2
we stayed in tower _num_ which is supposedly the nicer of the two .,2
we greatly enjoyed the dim sum and that 's all we ate there .,2
we greatly enjoyed the dim sum and that 's all we ate there .,2
"but then again , upgrades make the room price go up .",2
then ordered their creme brulee for dessert that looked great and tasted great .,2
"ok , here goes nothing ... .",2
and there was no fridge .,2
the food is done well and the ambiance makes the dining experience worthwhile .,2
my room was nice and clean .,2
the shrimp is very good .,2
we were here last year as well .,2
wo n't stay there again .,2
it was very much worth the price .,2

all in all circus circus will always have my business !,2
very outdated and we booked a king room .,2
"i did n't actually stay here , i 'm just reviewing the ambience .",2
this was my second time at this spago and it was fantastic .,2
to put it in perspective think your average cafeteria cheese steak .,2
too bad though cause dr .,2
for my birthday i decided to get my industrial piercing in my left ear .,2
so many things and very affordable .,2
"when i say horrible , i mean just embarrassing .",2

"the service is great , the prices good , and food is fun .",2
bad : housekeeping service .,2

i checked out of this filthy place _num_ hrs later and will never return .,2
i usually hit up the one in the planet hollywood miracle mile mall .,2
i 'd rather go watch the bellagio fountains again .,2

everything is broken and the staff is rude .,2
i was n't tempted to take pictures with anyone .,2

staff are very friendly and quick on service .,2
"any time an issue came up , it was someone else fault .",2
this place is classy and open to all with the restaurant attached .,2
the pilot was awesome and kept us informed the whole way their and back .,2
if only i had researched them before buying our home ... .,2

"or negatives , even .",2
the service was excellent !,2
the concierge was even rude .,2
"our servers name was josh , and he was terrible .",2
"good service , guacamole was very good too .",2
this place is really gross .,2
the service was fast so that always was a plus .,2
i recall having a pepperoni and mushroom pizza that was mostly grease and dough .,2
and then they made me sit for an hour .,2

the iron was broken so i could n't iron my clothes while i waited .,2

i would not stay here again unless it was free .,2
you do n't serve kid friendly food !,2
the inside of my truck was not wet at all .,2
i 'll definitely come back just for the jerk shrimp !,2
did n't get any sleep .,2
this place does not deserve the stars that it has !,2
the service was pretty good .,2
do n't ever stay here !,2
"absolutely , hands down the worst service i have ever had .",2
our first room in tower _num_ had missing wall plates for the outlets .,2
"in fact , every dish ranged from very good to excellent .",2
it 's pretty bad when the circus circus does a better job .,2
their happy hour food is actually good .,2
the arcade below the excalibur ?,2
they also offered to remove the $ _num_ early check in fee .,2
the staff was nice and helpful .,2

we will definitely go back again .,2
the place is small but really nice .,2
the bagel was great and the amount of lox they put on is yum !,2

perfect for lunch or earlier dinner .,2

what ... the ... fuck ?,2
"great prices , but it 's cash only .",2
mushroom soup and mushroom ravioli is amazing !,2

they have the best alcoholic beverages ever !,2
and such vintage feeling as well .,2
"give your business to people who want to be helpful , not these characters .",2
i loved this place !,2

it is a cool place .,2
the casino is flat out dirty .,2
it was nothing special .,2
we shared the empanadas ( good ) and flautas ( spectacular ) .,2

i found the check-in counters & it was quite confusing .,2
the staff is pleasant and courteous and we 've never had an issue here .,2
best prices for a great hotel .,2
"room smells , ugly view , for _num_ for two nights ?",2
save some extra cash and go elsewhere .,2
_num_ star is all that i can say .,2

"oh , yeah , no bath tub .",2
even the cooked foods like the mini beef steak was off somehow .,2
the happy hour specials are pretty good .,2
it needs renovations and a better cleaning crew .,2

the duck breast was nearly white it was so over cooked .,2
best tapas in vegas .,2
businesses are trying hard .,2
cheesecake and creme brle were executed extremely well .,2
went with a good friend of mine who has been coming here for years .,2
they just would n't stop .,2
was starving so decided to try it out .,2
it 's a must in vegas .,2
"buffet was a joke , even for a pretty low price for breakfast .",2
a wide variety of choices to choose from .,2
"overall , it 's a great restaurant .",2
the bathroom sink and floor were covered in hair .,2
"usually , the rates are cheaper if you stay on weekdays .",2
advice : spend the extra money and skip the castle .,2
i was so angry that i did n't bother .,2
love the _num_ day passes !,2
great drinks and service .,2
"`` i do n't live here , i live in seattle . ''",2
i love the midway !,2
has to be one of the worst place for a trade show .,2
i hate this place .,2
this is not what i expected for an _num_ plus tax sandwich .,2
we liked it so much we went back again the next evening for dinner .,2
the bathrooms are disgusting with piss everywhere and the whole place is just filthy .,2

"smooth atmosphere , reasonably priced , and the food is great .",2
just the right portion size .,2
"casual , eclectic atmosphere makes it comfortable for anybody .",2

the place looked very nice and very trendy .,2
the customer service is bad .,2
because the first one was _num_ lb bigger .,2

worst stay at a las vegas hotel so far .,2
the pay outs are n't bad and the adventure dome is really fun !,2
"potatoes and cabbage out of season , perhaps .",2
basically what it comes down to is do n't stay here .,2
another suspicious thing occurred at this hotel .,2
super great location and clean rooms !,2
i will give las vegas wan na be 's some credit .,2
but no worries i am here for the shrimp .,2
the wait time while in the office is unacceptable .,2
overall a nice place to stay while u in vegas .,2
"the rooms are nice , and the beds are comfortable as well .",2
did not like service at all .,2
my boyfriend had the spaghetti and he loved it as well .,2

its like being at the circus and all the employees are extra nice .,2
the food and atmosphere is great .,2
the waiter was very funny and nice .,2
went above and beyond to make sure i looked hot and flawless .,2
this was the worse hotel i 've stayed at in los vegas .,2
this is a very good jewish style deli .,2
this was a great start to a perfect dinner .,2
it smells more like dust and smoke than most of the other hotels .,2
lets do it again !,2
"the atmosphere was cool , but maybe i 'm not a spanish cuisine person ?",2
i highly recommend this place for a quick bite to eat for lunch .,2
feel sorry for the employees .,2
them people that works there do n't know how to greet customers properly .,2
i 'm in tower _num_ which is suppose to be the better tower .,2
"the staff seemed burned out , and not to care about good customer service .",2
"overall , this place is fantastic .",2
went back to the room around 6:30 in the morning and slept .,2
"this is the second time this happened , first time to complain .",2
"so we went expecting good food , good drinks and good prices .",2
they really need to give this hotel a makeover .,2

but then it was time to get change from the machine .,2

i love the mix and match the flavors .,2
room : at same level or below a motel _num_ .,2
"wow , wow , wow !",2
the mardi gras tower needs an update badly .,2
"old , dingy , better places to stay .",2
"i mean its cheap , its fun , and its good !",2

pretty much cleaned my plate .,2
"nothing in the room is updated , and there is poop on our window !",2
worst place in town by far !,2
the pool is the worst i have seen in vegas .,2
but this never happened .,2
for this `` neighborhood '' that is a deal !,2
got back around _num_ pm no one had fixed the window .,2
-- -- -the hotel itself was also disgusting !,2
"the iron was not cleaned and had old , cold water still in it .",2
it was _num_ pm by the time my name issue was resolved .,2
you can park and fly for _num_ dollars !,2
"the bedding was not comfortable , really nothing special about this place whatsoever .",2

the tables and the dealers were worn out and not in a good way .,2
"the hotel is not a luxury hotel , but is clean and nice .",2
sorry to bother you sir .,2
great fun and super safe .,2
of course the hot tea we have to beg for was not included .,2
"rooms in the resort tower are dated , at best .",2
"it had circus performances , karaoke , the amusement park , etc .",2
his service was worse than food court on the street .,2
it was still good and nicely cold .,2
the filet sliders are beyond awesome !,2
the toilet runs all night .,2
i 'm sure she had better things to do ... not a bad experience .,2
but damn - i love this store and the forum shops .,2
this place is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in vegas .,2
next month you pay $ _num_ for water and $ _num_ for lights !,2
the rooms are big and comfortable .,2
"the two stars are based on the food only , which was amazing .",2
the philly was surprisingly dry and lacking flavor .,2
we will definitely go back and stay there again !,2
food was ok and service was really bad .,2
i thought i was inside !,2
i highly recommend the quesadilla .,2
"great hours , the staff is very helpful and patrons are friendly .",2
this place needs to be torn down .,2
the customer service was terrible .,2
i got it with pastrami and loved it .,2
it really is n't much .,2
every time with positive feedback .,2
great affordable option in the venetian .,2
the food is incredibly good and fresh .,2
"i wanted to like this place , but i was disappointed .",2
i would give this hotel a zero if i could .,2
perfectly executed and delicious .,2
this place was a huge hit for our party of _num_ .,2
the bathrooms are gross .,2
arrived here at 6:30 am on sunday morning .,2
just do n't expect too much .,2
definitely got me toasted .,2
the staff was great .,2
the staff was great .,2
it 's truly the best one .,2
it is wide open and nicely decorated .,2
went to the firefly restaurant based upon their menu .,2
the place needs a desperate new coat of paint on the outside .,2
but apparently excalibur can not be bothered .,2
extremely slow check in .,2
"so flavorful , the ambiance was just perfect , and the staff was wonderful .",2
the service is excellent we had a wonderful experience .,2
definitely a must at vegas !,2
that typically goes for $ _num_ a night .,2
this place is a must if you 're heading out to vegas .,2
i 'll definitely be coming back .,2
we dont plan to eat in that place again for a long time anyway !,2
then why was the check-out sign placed there ?,2
it was a very nice place .,2
they had a supervisor come out and he helped us out immensely .,2
do n't believe their advertisement of `` free '' wireless .,2
lol i totally recommend .,2
"btw , the buffet sucks .",2
every last thing we ordered was interesting and amazing .,2
"i felt like a number , not a customer .",2
great food we always get two bowls of pork adobo .,2
_num_ minute wait is unacceptable .,2
one of my favorite restaurants in las vegas .,2
the ugly : the hotel is dated and needs a major facelift .,2
the angry chicken was okay ... could have been better .,2
i actually tend to really like harrah 's casinos .,2
this place was pretty good !,2
i was in heaven !,2
my biggest complaint was our hotel room key cards would not work !,2
i wo n't be back .,2
this is a really crappy hotel with really crappy customer service .,2
it took forever to get our bags though .,2
"i eat here about three or four times a year , breakfast and lunch .",2
to top it off they make a good mojito .,2
"as a local , one of my favorite places to go .",2
the bathrooms were decent but i 've seen nicer showers at motel _num_ .,2
remind me to never walk through there again !,2
"the slot manager gets props for having some newer games , however .",2
this place is actually really nice .,2
it stinks of raw sewage and the bathrooms are awful !,2
sangria but enjoyed a number of delights .,2
comparable to a junior suite at one of the casinos .,2
"i recommend having the tiramisu gelato , which is the best i 've had .",2
food was mostly very tasty and also very affordable .,2
very happy with the quality of the food and service !,2
the games were fun and easy to win too .,2
highly recommended as a place to come and play in vegas !,2
excalibur wanted $ _num_ and wanted me out by 3pm !,2
"great prices , large menu , wonderful staff , etc .",2
i was kinda iffy about staying here due to the cheap price .,2
i used to love going to that one with my mom as a child .,2
our beds were hard and worn .,2
dinner came and my veal bolognese was horrible .,2
very refreshing on a hot vegas day .,2
absolutely horrible and rude costumer service .,2
i would highly recommend it .,2
and its a shame because i really did like my room .,2
the pool scene was pretty sad .,2
i 've been a firefly customer for _num_ years !,2
it was really nice though !,2
thanks for a wonderful lunch experience !,2
ambience is great whether you dine in the cafe or main dining room .,2
definitely coming here again .,2
"the server promised biscuits again , and left .",2
we chose the seasonal tasting menu and were so impressed .,2
this one is my favorite !,2
i 've stayed at excalibur quite a few times .,2
as soon as i walked into the lobby the long lines shocked me .,2
just do n't do it .,2
its a great place to hang out with friends and family .,2
it was well worth it !,2
i 'm still trying to figure out what the hell that covered .,2
this place is awesome .,2
this place is awesome .,2
this place is awesome .,2
this place is awesome .,2
such a cool place to visit !,2
"all in all , a great restaurant .",2
she should have just thrown the crap away before she gave it to me .,2
everything in this hotel is run down .,2
was there on labor day weekend and it was a great experience .,2
servers were friendly and helpful .,2
i think it 's ideal .,2
all the tapas are great and the sangria makes is good as well .,2
"i upgraded to a suite , total nightmare .",2
but the pillows were hard and the beds were harder .,2
i think the employees really dropped the ball this time .,2
_num_ hour has a good selection of machines .,2
too may nice courses in lv to play this dump .,2
no theme to the casino as opposed to other hotels .,2
try to get there for happy hours .,2
the director wanted a nice blonde wig .,2
this was a holiday weekend and this place was empty .,2
the hotel room was what you 'd expect .,2
the garlic shrimp was amazing !,2
our first time and spago lives up to it 's reputation !,2
but it is not a option .,2
everything was absolutely delicious and i will definitely be back again .,2
i wish i had looked this place up on yelp before i played here .,2
"i 'm begging you , please stay somewhere else .",2
the casino was good as well .,2
"the food is amazing and unlike the rest of vegas , not over priced .",2
the food is inventive and delicious .,2
the excalibur is the worst hotel on the strip .,2
i highly recommend getting the giant margarita glass full of frozen margarita .,2
he wants to go again tomorrow and the next day !,2
is that how a store is supposed to be run ?,2
"as a vegas veteran , i know what to expect on the strip .",2
first off this restaurant is in serious need of a facelift .,2
_num_ yrs old facility going on _num_ .,2
i was pretty disappointed .,2
it was almost impossible to get a `` free '' drink .,2
"harrahs casino in las vegas , what can i say .",2
"other than that , spend a little more money to stay somewhere nicer !",2
it is absolute perfection !,2
always the `` best of the best '' regarding booze !,2
definitely world class service .,2
"it has a kids casino , amusement park , and circus shows .",2
the midway was fun and you ca n't beat free entertainment .,2
it closes too early and opens too late .,2
"absolutely terrible hotel , the worst i have experienced within the north america .",2
gone here before and many other car washes and never had this happen before .,2
this was my first tapas experience and i loved it .,2
it was supposed to be ready by _num_ pm .,2
came here twice so far .,2
it came with were dry .,2
awsome place and super friendly people .,2
then i shot it and loved it !,2
they gave exceptional service which was very much appreciated .,2
my carrot strip had more flavor .,2
it gets very very old after a while .,2
there is a bakery and everything is so yummy !,2
"on a good note , the room is clean and the beds were comfortable .",2
we used their pool and the laundry machine which is top rate .,2
"fantastic meal , the service and food were both perfect .",2
do n't even bother with this place .,2
this is one of the worst mc d 's .,2
( but that thing never happened . ),2
tonight may be the last night we ever go there .,2
i got the _num_ octane with one shot and it was good .,2
this is n't the case .,2
"it was however , very greasy .",2
they were busy so obviously people come here but sorely disappointed is an understatement .,2
matt was so very helpful and professional today .,2
"anywho , love love love !",2
happy hour prices are ridiculous .,2
this is my favorite hotel casino in vegas .,2
apparently it 's a `` request '' not a reservation .,2
food here is also pretty good .,2
a bit pricy but well worth the money .,2
"friends , family , dates , this place is perfect for everyone !",2
no wifi in the room is awful .,2
jenny is amazing at doing nails !,2
level of service was superb from the whole team .,2
"great food , cool atmosphere !",2
pros -- cheap room price .,2
i stayed here with my wife for a couple of nights .,2
sugar content : extremely high .,2
she left an electronic tag on my yoga pants .,2
the staff is so attentive and professional - they are flawless .,2
i can say we all enjoyed our meals and the customer service was great .,2
"no shower , etc .",2
a great place to make a great impression for a business meeting .,2
will not go back to this location again .,2
there was mold in the shower .,2
the mall itself is very old looking from the outside .,2
definitely a disappointing meal .,2
what a great shop !,2
surprisingly they have a pretty decent pool .,2
bartender is less than zero .,2
the bacon wrapped stuff dates are awesome !,2
"service was friendly , but inattentive .",2
thank you so much from myself and my son !,2
you can always ask for more shots to put in your frozen delight .,2
the food came out really fast and was packed with flavor .,2
managers are extremely nice always around and checking on tables .,2
"had a little fridge and microwave and glass cups , even silverware .",2
the staff is friendly and helpful even when it 's quite busy .,2
hubby had and enjoyed the jerk chicken pasta .,2
excellent italian cuisine where they will customize your meal .,2
"everything we tasted were great , but by far my favorite is the lentils .",2
i 'd definitely eat there again .,2
i 'd definitely eat there again .,2
so happy we chose it as one of our dinner spots .,2
disappointed that they had run out of tempura green tea ice cream .,2
this place is the absolute worst .,2
the view from the restaurant window was terrific with the bellagio 's fountain show .,2
"it was a very unique dining experience , being new to the tapas concept .",2
my boyfriend and i were both very disappointed in our stay .,2
"service is immediate , bread , butter , drink orders , water all happen .",2
i was also pleased with the variety of dining choices .,2
it is worth the drive off the strip .,2
lots of fun folks running around here .,2
"that is actually false , apart from the eating with your hands part .",2
"it was cheap , in many ways .",2
it came out within ten minutes and was all hot and delicious .,2
this is not good business practices .,2
laugh with authentic vegas people ... god totally fun !,2
"but do n't play the slots there , you ca n't win !",2
the whole enterprise is an embarrassment to good taste .,2
i could eat two of those and make it my dinner .,2
"most pages wo n't load , if they do it takes 3-4 minutes .",2
"refunded money , upgraded us , and gave us a late check out .",2
the room in tower i was very stuffy .,2
terrible food & bad service .,2
the starbucks wo n't take starbucks cards .,2
thank you dr. k and staff for your outstanding services .,2
for a college student this is a good place to kick it .,2
it 's just what you do ... .,2
i ate here on saturday night and i loved it .,2
the food was bad the eggs were not good !,2
i guess they truly did n't wish to sell the car .,2
i recommend getting the cheese plate appetizer and the sea bass .,2
"it has a small kitchen , a good size fridge and a microwave .",2
not at all satisfied even with the discount price i paid .,2
but we notice not one difference in the room after that whole ordeal .,2
best happy hour in vegas !,2
"the food was average , but the service was beyond slow .",2
"the casino downstairs is okay , but not that great .",2
fat tuesday is great for getting a quick buzz .,2

amazing food at inexpensive prices .,2
this place was really good !,2
"quite honestly one of the best restaurants i 've eaten at , ever.",2
"seafood dishes are absolutely fresh , not bad for a chain restaurant .",2
food is excellent quality and prepared fresh and it shows in the taste .,2
disappointed to say the least and i had low expectations going into this place .,2
the drinks are good too .,2
he got so annoyed that we decided to get some sandwiches .,2
i just left ; hungry and disappointed !,2
this has to be the worst mcdonald 's i have ever been to .,2
there is no zen at this buddha dump .,2
the paradise location is the best .,2
"guacamole is perfect , as is the queso fundido .",2
"by this time , we were frustrated , super tired and just angry .",2
next best thing is it 's pretty mid strip !,2
i definitely got a good buzz from the octane .,2
windows so dirty you could n't see through them .,2
for a nicer experience get a suite .,2
our room was very nice .,2
but for a regular local there is n't much to see or do .,2
"if you 're staying at a casino hotel , you should stay somewhere else .",2
"however , we definitely will not be staying here again .",2
"personally , i like the regular margaritas with an extra shot for $ _num_ .",2
i was also extremely disappointed by the customer service .,2
we had our wedding reception here and it was amazing .,2
the suite was awesome and my friends normal room was nice as well .,2
great off the strip happening spot .,2
wallpaper was patch worked & falling off the walls .,2
the bathroom in the room was moldy and musty and needed a complete remodel .,2
tip # _num_ : make sure to order the calamari to start !,2
i try to visit when in lv and really enjoy the food and service .,2
i washed my color clothes for about _num_ .,2
customer service deserves negative stars .,2
i recently stayed here on a quick _num_ night trip to vegas .,2
i do n't know if i 'll come back to this place .,2
only go here if you are expecting for over an hour to check in .,2
"first , our waiter was top notch .",2
this is by far the worst experience i have had at any hotel .,2
the charge you $ _num_ for high speed internet .,2
"oh , and the staff hate the guests .",2
free parking for my rental car was great .,2
the customer service was poor and unfriendly .,2
this place has never and probably will never do seafood justice .,2
amazing food and super fun ambiance !,2
the air conditioning in the room was either too cold or not working .,2
all the food is excellent there .,2
"carmax was alright , but i hate buying a car .",2
the _num_ min craps were fun and a great deal .,2
quit so someone who wants to work can do it .,2
half the dessert menu requires that you order it _num_ minutes prior .,2
$ _num_ to $ _num_ for a fast food burger ?,2
and it wouldnt turn back off !,2
a very cool experience .,2
this place deserves _num_ stars !,2
"apparently , english was n't her first language , either .",2
i did get a discount .,2
"ok , so check this out .",2
however this time the soup tasted like a bowl of water .,2
"fine , we were just wanting a few rolls and some miso anyways .",2
aside from that not worth staying there unless they comp you a room .,2
the service was attentive and the food arrived promptly and tasted delicious .,2
yeah ... not quite .,2
one of the best things i 've ever eaten in lv .,2
even the mojitos were good .,2
i think that 's so ridiculous .,2
i would never stay there again even if it was free .,2
will never stay here nor recommend it unless you want a dirt cheap hotel .,2
from all the hotels we where looking circus circus had the best price .,2
i thought that the food was very good .,2
"my pain relief meds , etc .",2
"beware , they only want your money .",2
nasty game they play .,2
"i love this place , best gelato spot in vegas .",2
we were told that was the only available table ... but it was n't .,2
chips and salsa were really really good .,2
the tv was broken and would n't turn on .,2
chef did their part but my mood was ruined already .,2
came for happy hour .,2
ate there today and the food was really good !,2
it had a fast food food court and a questionable buffet .,2
and i honestly wanted to love this place but everything was mediocre at best .,2
they even have me comps for the buffet and comped my resort fee .,2
"i definitely had one more shot , hahaha .",2
far superior to most of the hotel high dollar famous chefs .,2
everything was pretty good and once again the prices were great .,2
"they also have a full bar , including a wide selection of flavored mojitos .",2
probably would not return .,2
customer service is also great .,2
i had really good time there .,2
the margarita flavor is pretty good .,2
literally little chewy rubber bands of bland breading .,2
forget this place and stay at the tropicana !,2
they said no because we had insurance .,2
"the staff , for the most part is friendly and accommodating .",2
i like that they have two different menus .,2
great attention and service .,2
this place is a disgusting joke .,2
"smelly , smelly , smelly .",2
its ridiculous to pay for parking and then for there to be none .,2
nice white wine list .,2
"the sides were good too ... some flavored rice , and black beans .",2
"_num_ minutes later , no water .",2
customer service is always friendly .,2
that was a fun afternoon .,2
i definitely loved the selections we all got .,2
then _num_ mins just to get our food .,2
always add a shot though .,2
its great for large groups or a small date .,2
the sangria is also super tasty .,2
this is completely unacceptable .,2
that would have been nice to know at booking .,2
wo n't be using them again if possible .,2
awesome ... authentic street food .,2
the best cheap hotel that i prefer is the flamingo .,2
i was so disappointed with the deal .,2
_num_ octane and hurricane together are great .,2
why do they even put people in such conditions ?,2
they definitely topped my expectations .,2
it really has that caribbean feel to it .,2
the inside is beautiful .,2
"all flash , no substance .",2
i would only stay here again if i was desperate .,2
housekeeping did a fantastic job keeping my room clean for a week .,2
happy hour on point and the drinks are strong !,2
both were very delicate and rich in flavors .,2
"free shuttle to rio , bally 's and paris .",2
i was impressed with the monorail !,2
the place is nothing special .,2
the food was delicious and the servers were very friendly and helpful !,2
the service was quite good as was the food .,2
the maintenance man that came was grumpy and halfway rude .,2
highly recommend these folks !,2
the pasta was so delicious .,2
great find in the area .,2
"thank you once again , i will back again soon .",2
price for both w/ coffee - $ _num_ .,2
excalibur did n't disappoint my low expectations .,2
but our dragon family style meal was outstanding !,2
there are only _num_ customers in the whole place !,2
great deal for _num_ of us .,2
they had lots of military guns to choose from and their prices were great !,2
will defiantly be coming back !,2
you ca n't sell until you pay it off completely .,2
"like i said , its basically a holiday inn on the strip .",2
pleasant atmosphere with cool decor .,2
great restaurant that we go to every time we 're in town .,2
it was that good .,2
"service and suits were good , but wanted a second opinion before buying .",2
you must also try their sparkling sangria ... very good .,2
the one thing i will mention about the tapas : seafood dishes are good .,2
the wall paper in the bathroom was peeling .,2
told her it was unacceptable .,2
`` cough drops ? '',2
the size of this place is ridiculously small .,2
but the dates were incredible .,2
"if you are in las vegas , treat yourself to this las vegas landmark .",2
i loved all the items they carry .,2
chips and salsa are great !,2
the pizza with the egg on top was phenomenal .,2
extremely strong and delicious drinks .,2
i can not wait to check out of this place .,2
instead of relaxing i had to listen to these little kids run around .,2
driving there and back just took an hour out of my day .,2
"_num_ of them _num_ star , _num_ of them _num_ star .",2
the bagel : nothing special at all .,2
"if i could , i would give them _num_ stars .",2
this place is nasty .,2
delicious and left enough room for the pie .,2
i also appreciate that they make their own pastrami .,2
i always have the sangria .,2
they definately are not maintained however .,2
definitely recommend this place so far .,2
nothing to report there .,2
"cool atmosphere , great staff and terrific food .",2
he was much better than the waiter .,2
a lot of food for what you pay too !,2
"the ceviche was amazing , the bacon wrapped dates were also amazing .",2
these diced potatoes were mushy and sticky in a weird kind of way .,2
"suffice it to say , i will never stay here again .",2
everything was a success .,2
"gambling is relaxed and fun , many new upgrades have been done .",2
then he stared at us and wondered why he did n't get a tip .,2
our two boys were so excited to go for the first time .,2
"please improve , do n't make me stop coming here altogether .",2
"excellent , cool and refreshing on a hot vegas day !",2
great place to go and prices were reasonable !,2
"i 've been here twice now , and i 'll be back again !",2
"i had no other choice , i was told to stay here .",2
"have been here maybe _num_ years ago , pretty disappointing .",2
the almond stuffed dates are awesome !,2
i had the jerk shrimp appetizer with the cuban bread and loved it .,2
"ok , i guess it 's self service .",2
"great service , fresh bagels , great prices .",2
the service was great and the portion size was just the right amount .,2
if you 're in vegas this is the nike for you .,2
my friend and i were getting the $ _num_ spa mani and pedi .,2
you know when it is bad when their dessert are not home made .,2
great place for visitors from out of town or for special occasions .,2
wifi did n't work .,2
the penne ala vodka was good .,2
we got there and immediately noticed it was very hot !,2
do n't waste your time here !,2
harrahs is not where i will be staying ever again .,2
"fun atmosphere , and delicious .",2
i did n't even stay here so i am reviewing their casino floor .,2
"the room itself was decent , nothing special .",2
"overall , i do not regret my surgery , i regret using them .",2
i got the lobster gnocchi which was pretty good .,2
not happy with them .,2
the whole thing is disgusting .,2
i left a message and never got a call back .,2
that makes a start to for a fun day .,2
the room was decent and clean and the staff was helpful and polite .,2
you can also check in early so you have a table waiting .,2
wo n't go back .,2
"try it once , and you 'll be hooked .",2
i highly recommend spago .,2
the twin sisters that play are awesome !,2
it was a bit strange .,2
beds are comfy but it 's downhill from there .,2
i hear they got a spot like this in the bay now too .,2
miso soup was way too salty .,2
everything is always fresh but perhaps a little pricey .,2
did i say horrible ?,2
"yelp helped me find the place for a business meeting , everyone loved it .",2
this was my worst automotive decision ever .,2
saved us a cab ride or _num_ !,2
wait times are incredibly long .,2
there is construction being done at 7am and they were not aware .,2
there were hardly people there and it was n't fun at all .,2
chips came with fresh guacamole and salsa .,2
later i found out that it is a korean run restaurant .,2

"great bagels , great eats , fun environment !",2
it is literally just a decent place to sleep and shower .,2

highly recommend this hospital for children they truly and honestly care for their patients .,2
purchased weekend stay thru expedia .,2
"they are this amazing combination of tart , sweet , and refreshing .",2
and agnolotti pasta was excellent !,2
the arcade is awful .,2
the hotel amenities are among the worst on the strip .,2
nothing luxury about it .,2
not paying for something that i did not receive .,2
i own the business across the street and they always waste my time .,2
i never once got cold food .,2
our waiter was very attentive and friendly .,2
best place to have lunch and or dinner .,2
although i 'm not an expert on mexican food i enjoyed this experience .,2
to begin this hotel was relatively expensive compared to some places here in vegas .,2
he is super nice and helpful .,2
"eventually , many of my friends stayed here and i went elsewhere .",2
but at night they are slower than slow .,2
and now here i am _num_ days later still throwing up .,2
the bread was really good too .,2
i have never seen an air filter as filthy as this one .,2
"first off , who puts pink roses on a ninja turtle cake ?",2
i give this place _num_ stars for their sushi and sushi chef .,2
"i agree with all the bad reviews , save your money !",2
this is absolutely ridiculous !,2
excellent service and selection .,2
do n't settle just to be on the strip .,2
ambiance was trendy and romantic - great date spot .,2
the tapas platters were all each very good .,2
i just checked into the contemporary superior room and am definitely not impressed .,2
great food and great service with an incredible ambiance !,2
the best part is it 's free !,2
the room was nice though .,2
"staff , food and eric the chef ... top notch !",2
"good dining experience , but a bit pricey .",2
also the water served did n't taste that good .,2
get to the room and ugh .,2

price for rooms were great .,2
but you get what you pay for ... not much .,2

service was great and the food was an adventure .,2
the food here was delicious .,2
there was no central ac .,2
"warning : to all future vegas tourists , this is overpriced .",2

i recommend stopping by .,2
they said that area is full is so ridiculous .,2
always a good time : ) cheers !,2
it was overall a good stay and i would definitely come back .,2
the wifi was `` down '' for the whole time we stayed there .,2
it ruined out trip .,2
they have so much flavor !,2
"yeah , just do n't .",2

they took care of us pretty good.,2

my favorites are the eggplant cannelloni and the dates .,2
buffet was pretty bad ... see my review for it .,2
"when we arrived , we were told there would be a _num_ minute wait .",2
if you want them to print out your boarding pass another $ _num_ .,2
the guy serving me was very friendly and efficient .,2
free wi-fi advertised but very weak signal - constantly lost contact .,2
he did n't offer us desserts i had to ask for it myself .,2
did not even offer water at the time we placed the order .,2
i have stayed there maybe 10-15 times .,2
"$ _num_ chicken wings - basic order wings , hot sauce , ranch .",2
the layout of this store is so very nice .,2
"seriously , no other way to describe it other than butt .",2
i came back _num_ minutes later to find the car still sitting there .,2
i came back _num_ minutes later to find the car still sitting there .,2
"the food was decent , but the server was horrible .",2
overall it was great .,2
love the con ... hate the venue .,2
"the place is divey for sure , but it 's great !",2
they have a great selection of beers and cocktails in the happy hour !,2
the only bright spot was buca di beppo .,2
"the food is absolutely amazing , great selection , kind manager .",2
this place is essentially the motel _num_ of the strip .,2
i could bare my hear the waiter or the other guests at my table .,2
trash is everywhere inside and outside .,2
this is a piece of crap property .,2
i 'm glad i did n't .,2
there has to better choices off the strip .,2
waste of money and overrated !,2
i got the paella and really enjoyed .,2
there 's no safety bolt on the door .,2
"had an amazing , cozy , romantic dinner with my husband .",2
the portion are not satisfying for the price you have to pay per dish .,2
this is fine dining .,2
drove past this place so many times over the years and never stopped .,2
i like that this location is off the strip so probably not as busy .,2
finally after _num_ hours decided to deal with once in vegas .,2
went to the cafe for diner and there _num_ prime rib special .,2
"it is great food , great service and great atmosphere .",2
it 's just too bad that they 're stuck at this crappy hotel .,2
she 's hard at hearing .,2
the empanadas were very good and the dipping sauce even better .,2
even the mustard was tasteless and old tasting .,2
i 'm sure they 'll go out of business soon .,2
the safe in the room did not work .,2
i highly doubt they are serving fresh chicken .,2
"this place said no to separate checks , so many of our group left .",2
"the parent was in the actual dining room , not the play area room .",2
"instead , he came back and gave me a new card .",2
this was a huge mistake .,2
the food taste sooooo good .,2
good food but bad service .,2
our server was very nice and patient .,2
the hotel also has access to the monorail .,2
food is a _num_ if i could rate it .,2
still the same horrible quality .,2
still the same horrible quality .,2
did n't think much about it since we were n't staying there .,2
"_num_ hours later , i returned to my room .",2
i think circus circus is better than this place .,2
i just signed up for yelp to write a review of this hotel .,2
"the assortment of breads is great , esp .",2
i 've stayed here almost every time i visit vegas .,2
i have never stayed at a hotel and seen this .,2
we will not stay here next time .,2
"absolutely wonderful service , staff , and care .",2
the food is still great and i 'll be back again and again .,2
i 've had great service at discount firearms !,2
it 's always good walking through in here !,2

the chips with salsa and guacamole is a must !,2
we stayed in the `` better tower '' which is number _num_ .,2
wonderful food at the cafe side .,2
"staff was friendly , but food was not all that great .",2
i woke up one morning to find cockroaches crawling over my shoes .,2
they did n't give us the drinks with the kids meals .,2
i loved my sweet and sour pork .,2
there are no mirrors in the rooms besides the one in the bathroom .,2
wolfgang 's chinese take on chicken salad still is the best !,2
i also loved the shrimp with chili sauce ; lots of spice and flavor .,2
good homemade food in a restaurant .,2
it put a bad taste in all our mouths .,2
great place to come to get traditional filipino food .,2
you would think someone would get _num_ + _num_ .,2
the casino always has a good vibe and the rooms are always clean .,2
after ordering brownie with ice cream i gave up .,2
"no bugs , but i did find hair ... and lots of it !",2
do n't waist your money on this filthy dirty place !,2
i think it sums up how old and backwards the hotel is .,2
this place gets a good crowd .,2
my husband and i stayed here for three nights .,2
we sat at the bar and bartender did a great job serving us .,2
will not come again and will not suggest to any of my friends .,2
"it does n't smell weird , either .",2
i ca n't say i enjoyed myself here .,2
love the table games here .,2
it practically sounded like the windows were open .,2
the walls are also paper thin .,2
i am so glad that i found this place !,2
i really do love this place .,2
i 'm better off going to a different furniture company .,2
but why is it so damn cold at night during the summer !,2
everything we 've tried here has been great .,2
happy hour is great .,2
the staff is incredibly friendly and really make you feel welcome .,2
my stylist was rude and was shaking when she was doing my hair .,2

central to the strip and beautiful through and through .,2
overall we had a great experience and would return to circus circus .,2
lobster shanghai style was delicious .,2
"but this property in las vegas is old , dirty and low class now .",2
really enjoyed the pineapple margarita that was recommended by server .,2
some of them are outstanding at that .,2
the food was surprisingly tasty .,2
its not that it is a dive .,2
"the rooms are nice , clean , comfortable and the price is very reasonable .",2
the huge pool was not open during our whole stay .,2

beds are hard and there is no fridge or microwave .,2
the ceiling has an ugly water leak stain across the top .,2

plenty of other better ayce restaurants in vegas .,2
she could of just said no .,2
which just helped the already beautiful atmosphere .,2
harrah 's is in serious need of a complete renovation top to bottom .,2
next time i think we will pay the extra money to stay elsewhere .,2
i could n't get help because no one seemed to understand english .,2
"amazing food , this location it is always pretty packed so plan accordingly .",2
not comfortable at all .,2
"really , really liked this place .",2
this was the last hotel stay during our national park tour before flying home .,2
the staff and dealers are rude .,2
i hate seeing good people get treated like garbage .,2
i would strongly urge anyone to think twice about going here .,2
the dinning options here are not acceptable .,2
i could not win with these rooms .,2
loved my spinach salad and the salmon and sweet corn were to die for .,2
thank you firefly and aaron for a wonderful meal and fabulous drinks !,2
was n't too impressed with the room though .,2

sorry harrah but you lost our business .,2
do n't waste your time .,2
do n't waste your time .,2
"worst service , i checked out early .",2
we are n't coming back .,2

next time im going to the butcher block on south rainbow .,2
staff was very nice and accomodating .,2
spago is always one of the best ... .,2
it 's refreshing with their coconut shrimp pasta .,2
"to me , that 's unacceptable , regardless of how cheap the rooms are .",2

we did receive awesome discounts for food and drinks .,2

this place is an absolute joke .,2
one of my favorite places since moving to vegas .,2
"each time i went there , i took advantage of the tuesday special .",2
the decor has n't changed in years .,2
then i shot at the range today !,2
all they did was to offer me a refund on my resort taxes .,2

we had a caesar that was very good .,2
the food is delicious !,2
the chicken wings were way too sweet .,2

i am sure the other flavors are great as well .,2
i asked them what happened and they told me it was already like that .,2
the corn agnolotti pasta dish is soooo delicious .,2
matt had me in the right direction and i picked an awesome wig !,2
this place cracks me up !,2
it does not compare to the one in southern california which is way newer .,2
"rooms are clean , stocked , and smells really good .",2
tip : expand to the airport ... .,2
strawberry is great too .,2
bed is rock hard and the lights in the bathroom do n't work .,2
there are plenty of options for grabbing a quick bite .,2
this is my favorite casual restaurant in all of vegas to date !,2
enjoy it if you 're in vegas .,2
but the rooms are tiny and the beds are not that great .,2
overall a terrible experience .,2
one of my least favorite ross locations .,2
its reasonably priced and pretty fast .,2
"he made my sandwiches , then cut them wrapped them and put them aside .",2
this is the best spanish restaurant period !,2
the best part was we shared it !,2
this particular experience was un acceptable .,2

but vegas offers few choices so we went .,2
it was rather dry considering it 's price .,2
the best cheapest way to get around .,2
"it was undercooked in places , lacked cheese and flavor !",2
"i recomend the squash soup , so creamy and full of flavor .",2
this was a great little place tucked away off the strip .,2
doug was my instructor the first time an he is great .,2
be cautious and remember you get what you pay for !,2
overall we had a great experience .,2
this is certainly not a place fork people who want to eat healthy .,2
cost : $ _num_ plus taxes fees etc .,2
was told i would be contacted by risk management but never heard a word .,2

prepare to be approached by timeshare salesmen .,2

the staff here is genuine and actually listen to your shopping needs .,2
"really good tapas , but go for happy hour .",2
they did a good job .,2

i 'm not even exaggerating .,2
i was so happy to get the good news from them .,2
"gals , i know what you go through and i feel ya !",2
happy hour at the bar is fun as they give you little appetizers .,2
